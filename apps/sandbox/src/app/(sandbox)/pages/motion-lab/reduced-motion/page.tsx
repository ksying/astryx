          What a component author copies. Movement is a multiplier so the policy
          lands in one place; loops stop rather than slow; hover motion is gated
          on a fine pointer because touch fires a hover on tap; and the
          attribute branch exists because an app with its own reduce-motion
          setting can flip a JS library but cannot flip a media query.

          Both halves ship together or the system disagrees with itself: a chart
          that animates while the interface around it has stopped is worse than
          either policy applied consistently.
