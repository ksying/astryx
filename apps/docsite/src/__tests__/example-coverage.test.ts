/**
 * @file Example-coverage report (report-only).
 *
 * Prints, for every configured integration package and for Core, how many
 * authored doc-example labels have a paired runnable block — starting from the
 * AUTHORED files, so an example that silently renders as a CLI snippet (no
 * runnable demo) is visible in CI logs. This is a REPORT, not a gate: Core
 * does not require pairing and integration packages are intentionally no
 * stricter (owner decision, 2026-09-30); a repo-wide pairing gate remains an
 * open decision.
 *
 * @input Authored component docs and template descriptors across documented
 *   packages, plus the generated block registry
 * @output CI-visible coverage inventory and regression coverage for
 *   authored-block admission into the registry
 * @position Build-time docsite documentation-coverage reporting
 * Run: pnpm -F @astryxdesign/docsite test
