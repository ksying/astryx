 * Single decision point for whether a docsite content target admits workspace
 * integration packages (their component docs, runnable blocks, and playground
 * scope modules).
 *
 * @input A resolved docsite target ('canary' | 'latest') and the docsite
 *   astryx.config
 * @output Whether integration content is admitted, and the admitted package
 *   names in configuration order
 * @position Shared by scripts/generate-data.mjs, scripts/generate-scope.mjs and
 *   scripts/generate-playground-types.mjs so the production-exclusion rule
 *   cannot drift between generators. The
 *   production (`latest`) site must contain zero integration content — the
 *   configured packages are canary-only (e.g. @astryxdesign/lab, spec:AST-017).
 *   Unit-tested directly in src/__tests__/integration-targets.test.ts.

 * release, which never includes canary-only packages.

 * @returns {boolean}
