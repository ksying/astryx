Astryx v0.5.0 is out, gathering the eight releases since 0.4.0.

```bash
npm i @astryxdesign/core@0.5.0
```

Every stable `@astryxdesign/*` package ships at the same version, so bump them all to `0.5.0` to match. The canary-only packages — `lab`, `charts`, `richtext`, `vega` — version on their own line.

## Two breaking changes

Preview the migration first:

```bash
npx @astryxdesign/cli upgrade --from <your-version>
```

That is a dry run. Add `--apply` to write the changes to disk.

### Banner's collapse axis is one `collapsible` prop

`defaultIsExpanded` is removed, and content can opt out of collapsing entirely — the case a banner most often wants ([#5255](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5255)). `collapsible` takes a boolean or a config, the convention `SideNav.collapsible` set:

```tsx
// `status` and `title` are required on every Banner
<Banner status="error" title="Check 3 fields">…</Banner>                                 // unchanged: starts closed
<Banner status="error" title="Check 3 fields" collapsible={false}>…</Banner>             // always visible, no toggle
<Banner status="error" title="Check 3 fields" collapsible={{defaultIsOpen: true}}>…</Banner>   // replaces defaultIsExpanded
<Banner status="error" title="Check 3 fields" collapsible={{isOpen, onOpenChange}}>…</Banner>  // controlled
```

Default rendering is unchanged, and the codemod rewrites every call site that names the prop. It cannot see a spread — and neither can TypeScript, which does not excess-property-check one — so grep for `defaultIsExpanded` after it runs and migrate `<Banner {...props} />` by hand.

### One Escape dismisses one layer

Every overlay used to own its own Escape listener, so one press could close a Popover _and_ the Dialog hosting it. Overlays now share a single dismissal stack that routes each press to the top-most layer and nothing else ([#4881](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/4881)). A Tooltip inside a Dialog closes the tooltip.

Top-most comes from React-tree nesting, so it survives portals. A layer declares what it does with a press through `useLayerDismissal`'s `escapeBehavior` — `close`, or `block` for a required Dialog that has to swallow the press. Controlled layers, IME composition and browser-initiated dismissals like the Android back gesture all follow the same top-most rule.

There is no codemod, because no prop moved. One thing to know if you listen for Escape yourself: the stack claims a press with `preventDefault()` but leaves propagation alone, so a `keydown` listener on `window` now sees an Escape that a focus-trapped layer used to stop, with `defaultPrevented` already `true`.

### Also removed

The UMD bundle (`dist/astryx.umd.js`, plus the `unpkg` and `jsdelivr` package fields) is gone. It bound to `window.React`, and React 19 ships no build that defines one, so there was no working configuration to migrate from; `astryx template --cdn` writes the import-map page that replaces it. Three abandoned page templates went too: `table-page-chart`, `table-page-heatmap-status` and `table-page-shoe-store-heatmap`.

## Three promotions

A promotion means a component is out of the experimental `lab` package and into a package you can depend on. It always changes an import path, so it is the part of a release most likely to need your attention.

### Bottom Sheet → core (v0.4.4)

`BottomSheet` and `BottomSheetSwitcher` now come from `@astryxdesign/core` ([#5080](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5080)), and `snapPoints` makes the drag stops the host's choice — a viewport fraction (`0.5`), a percentage (`'50%'`), or a length (`'320px'`). A swipe that runs out of content keeps pulling and expands the sheet instead of stopping dead, a sheet resting at a detent re-resolves its geometry when the window resizes or the device rotates, and the mobile keyboard no longer shifts the page or moves the detents out from under the sheet.

![The same open Bottom Sheet rendered twice, light mode on the left and dark on the right. Each shows the top of a sheet on a narrow viewport: rounded top corners, a small grab handle centred above the content, a line of explanatory text, a divider, and a scrolling list of nearby places with distances running past the bottom of the frame.](/blog/astryx-v0-5-0/bottomsheet.png)

### Stepper → core (this release)

`Stepper` and `Step` now come from `@astryxdesign/core` ([#5201](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/5201)), with their horizontal and vertical layouts, separated and on-track indicators, semantic status, density and non-linear navigation. Advancing one step animates the connector — the accent fill grows out of the segment's leading edge, so moving forward reads as progress travelling the track. Going back, jumping several steps, mounting mid-flow and `prefers-reduced-motion` all apply at once.

![The same five-step Stepper rendered twice, light mode on the left and dark on the right. A vertical workspace-setup flow with the indicators sitting on the connector track itself: the first two steps complete with filled check indicators, the third current as a filled ring with a bold label, the last two upcoming as muted numbered circles. The track is solid through the completed steps and muted through the upcoming ones, and every step carries a one-line description under its label.](/blog/astryx-v0-5-0/stepper.png)

### RichTextEditor → `@astryxdesign/richtext` (v0.4.1)

The Lexical-based editor moved out of `lab` into its own package ([#4678](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/pull/4678)), so it can be canaried on its own. **This one is not a stabilization** — `@astryxdesign/richtext` publishes under `@canary` only, exactly as `lab` does. What changed for you is the import: `RichTextEditor`, `RichTextView` and `RichTextEditorToolbar` come from `@astryxdesign/richtext` now.

![The same RichTextEditor rendered twice, light mode on the left and dark on the right. Each is a field labelled "Notes" with a formatting toolbar across the top — undo, redo, a Paragraph block-type menu, then bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, code and link — above an editing area holding the sentence "Release notes for v0.5.0 — now in its own package.", with the version in bold.](/blog/astryx-v0-5-0/richtexteditor.png)

## Highlights

### 30 locales, and dates that follow your provider

Core shipped with `en` and `fr-FR`; it now carries 30 locale catalogs. `DateInput`, `DateTimeInput`, `DateRangeInput` and `Calendar` format and parse through the ambient `InternationalizationProvider` locale instead of the browser's, and Calendar weekday headers use CLDR stand-alone-short names. Live-region announcements in Selector, MultiSelector, Typeahead, FileInput, Tokenizer and Lightbox now come from the catalog with ICU plurals rather than an appended English "s". New `useLocale` and `useCollator` exports hand your own code the same locale for formatting and comparison.

CJK input is safe as well. `Selector`, `MultiSelector`, `Typeahead`, `DateInput`, `DateTimeInput`, `TimeInput` and `NumberInput` let an IME finish before reading a keydown as a command, so the Enter that commits a composition no longer commits the field with it — and the Escape that cancels one dismisses no layer.

### Themes now inherit from `extends`

A theme built with `extends` used to emit only its own declarations, so every consumer of an inheritance chain got stock geometry with a new palette painted over it. The base now resolves into the child's output, and `defineTheme` throws on a bad `extends` instead of inheriting nothing.

The focus ring is a token too — `--focus-outline-width`, `--focus-outline-style`, `--focus-outline-color` and `--focus-outline-offset` drive every ring in core and lab, so one override restyles focus system-wide. And `color.accent` accepts a `[light, dark]` tuple, deriving a palette for each scheme.

### Keyboard, pointer and touch

`TabList` speaks the WAI-ARIA tabs pattern when you assert `role="tablist"`, and a strip narrower than its tabs scrolls instead of spilling out of its container — every tab stays a tab, nothing hides behind a menu. `ButtonGroup` is a single tab stop with arrow-key movement between members. `Breadcrumbs` marks the current crumb with semibold weight rather than colour alone, which WCAG 1.4.1 requires and which the old tone-only treatment failed. Disabled elements across core and lab stop painting hover states and interactive cursors. On coarse pointers, the Slider track, `sm` checkboxes, radios and switches, and the shared clear button all meet the WCAG 2.5.8 AA 24×24 minimum — tappable area only; nothing visible moved.

### More to build with

- `FormLayout` takes `defaultOptionality`, so a form marks only the exception.
- `DateRangeInput` takes `minRangeSpan` and `maxRangeSpan`.
- `DateTimeInput` takes `timeOptionInterval` for a preset-time dropdown.
- `MultiSelector` formats its whole trigger line through `formatValue`.
- A `Table` plugin can suppress a body cell's content.
- `AspectRatio` emits `ratio` as a class-level declaration, so it can be overridden per breakpoint.
- PowerSearch browses up to 1,000 fields instead of 10, groups them by each field's `group`, applies `menuWidth` to the field and search menus, and honours `maxOperatorMenuItems` in value typeaheads.
- The Markdown parser rejects `javascript:`, `vbscript:` and `data:text/html` URLs. Incremental parsing holds its settled blocks across an open code fence: over a streamed 500-paragraph response, blocks rebuilt went from 126,756 to 1,869.

### CLI

`astryx theme targets` lists every component theming target — its `defineTheme` key, the class it paints, the props and states it accepts — with `--json` for lint and audit scripts. `astryx theme template` writes an annotated blank theme, and `astryx theme build` accepts any number of theme files in one process. `astryx template --cdn` writes a no-build-step page pinned to your installed version. Five new dashboard page templates join the template set. And an integration can contribute reference-doc topics that `astryx docs` serves and `astryx search` indexes.
