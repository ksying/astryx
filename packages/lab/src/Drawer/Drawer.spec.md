| Current Lab surface     | Public-API change aligning Drawer with Dialog (DEC-1). At this commit, the experimental `@astryxdesign/lab` root exports `Drawer`, `DrawerProps`, `DrawerHeader`, and `DrawerHeaderProps`. `DrawerProps` extends `BaseProps<HTMLDialogElement>`, separately declares `ref`, requires `isOpen`, `onOpenChange`, `label`, and `children`, accepts `purpose` (`required`, `form`, or `info`; default `info`), accepts an optional `padding` spacing step (FR16), and no longer accepts `hasCloseButton`. This records current reachability, not a stable compatibility promise.                                                                                                                                   |
| Behavior                | Drawer-owned visibility is controlled by the caller for a viewport-relative, full-height logical-side overlay. `hasScrim` at native open selects `showModal()` or a manual Popover API host; changing it while open is unsupported. The shared layer dismissal stack gates Escape and platform close for the full rendered lifetime, and `purpose` decides, as in Dialog, whether Escape, platform close, and scrim click request close. Drawer renders no close control of its own; `DrawerHeader` renders one only when given `onOpenChange`. The browser top layer owns paint order in both presentations, exit renders current children, and completed close returns focus to the element focused at open. |
| End-user impact         | Drawers no longer paint a floating top-trailing close button; a close button appears in a `DrawerHeader` title row where the caller composes one. `form` drawers ignore scrim clicks, and `required` drawers ignore Escape, platform close, and scrim clicks; a modal `required` drawer is announced as an alert dialog. Layer behavior (shared topmost/IME Escape, top-layer paint order, one dismissal per request, focus return) is unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Builder impact          | Remove `hasCloseButton`. For a visible close action, compose `<DrawerHeader title onOpenChange>` in a `Layout` header slot, as `DialogHeader` is composed in Dialog; set `padding={0}` for a full-bleed drawer, since the default inset is now `--spacing-4`; callers that passed `hasCloseButton={false}` need no change beyond removing the prop. Set `purpose` where Dialog would. State and content remain caller-owned; Drawer renders the caller's current children during exit. Sibling composition remains current consumer guidance, and a consumer `onKeyDown` that prevents default still cancels Escape dismissal.                                                                                 |
| Compatibility/readiness | Breaking Lab API change: removes `hasCloseButton` and the built-in close button, adds `purpose` and `DrawerHeader`. Drawer remains experimental in Lab, this record remains `draft`, and its candidate statements require approval. FR13–FR14 record shared-family and top-layer conformance; FR7 and FR15 record the Dialog alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Review checks           | Reject regional, docked, or block-axis models; claims that modality and scrim are currently independent; reintroduction of a Drawer-local Escape registry, a page-level z-index band, or a Drawer-owned close button; a dismissal policy that diverges from Dialog's `purpose`; claims that mixed-presentation or nested stacking is guaranteed beyond the shared stack's contract; or claims of stable API/theming compatibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Record context          | `component:Drawer` FR1–FR16 and AR1–AR6 are draft candidate statements. Linked records govern only within their own declared authority and scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

This table summarizes the draft body below; it does not change this record's declared authority.

## Intent

Drawer presents contextual details or controls in a full-height side panel that
floats over the current page without reflowing it. It supports modal inspection
with a scrim and non-modal master-detail inspection that leaves the page behind
available.

This draft records the viewport-only Lab component after its layer-lifecycle
hardening and its alignment with Dialog's close control and dismissal policy
(DEC-1). It introduces no scope concept. In particular, it does not revive a
regional, pane-scoped, or container-targeted Drawer model.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `not yet released`; Drawer remains in
  `@astryxdesign/lab`.
- Compatibility class: breaking change inside Lab. `hasCloseButton` and the
  built-in close button are removed; `purpose` and `DrawerHeader` are added. Root
  element, styling inputs, and controlled ownership remain unchanged.
- Container padding (FR16, DEC-2): a new `padding` prop, and a theme's
  `padding` on `drawer` insets the Content area through container tokens. With
  neither set the inset is `--spacing-4`, as in Dialog, so a drawer without an
  explicit `padding` is now padded; `padding={0}` keeps a full-bleed Content
  area. The block-end safe-area inset is kept in every mode.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged for Drawer-owned paths; callers
  provide `isOpen`, while direct native mutation through the public dialog ref is
  outside that guarantee.
- Migration decision: Drawer is unreleased Lab, so no codemod. Callers remove
  `hasCloseButton`, compose `DrawerHeader` with `onOpenChange` in a `Layout`
  header slot where they relied on the built-in button, and pass `padding={0}`
  where they need a full-bleed Content area.

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The viewport-relative side-panel surface, logical edge, inline-size budget, and
  entry/exit motion.
- The current presentation input: its value at native open selects `showModal()`
  or the manual Popover API host. Changing it while open is unsupported.
- Drawer-local focus entry/return, the `purpose` dismissal policy, uncanceled
  backdrop-click handling, and retention of its host through controlled exit
  while rendering current caller-owned children.
- The Content area's container padding, published per
  `architecture:container-padding`; the root dialog remains the overlay
  boundary owner.
- `DrawerHeader`: a title row with optional subtitle and start/end content, and a
  close action rendered only when `onOpenChange` is passed.
- Registering the layer with the shared dismissal stack for its rendered
  lifetime. Escape and platform-close routing belong to the shared owner; paint
  order in both presentations belongs to the browser top layer.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Caller-provided forms, inspectors, footers, or other content. `DrawerHeader`
  is optional composition, not required anatomy.
- Block-axis sheets — owned by `component:BottomSheet`.
- Persistent panels that reserve layout space or push page content.
- Regional or pane-scoped placement, a caller-supplied container, or independent
  modality and scrim axes. Those are not current Drawer concepts.
- Cross-family Escape and platform-close ordering — owned by
  `family:overlay-dismissal`; Drawer participates through the shared owner.
- Button painting for the `DrawerHeader` close action — delegated to
  `component:Button`; header row layout is delegated to `LayoutHeader`.

## Public concepts

Consumer prop syntax and examples remain in `Drawer.doc.mjs`.

| FR1  | Drawer MUST remain a viewport-relative, full-block-size overlay on the logical inline-start or inline-end edge and MUST NOT reserve layout space or reflow the page beneath it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Current source, docs, stories, and tests                         | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided                                                       |
| FR2  | The logical edge selected for an open Drawer MUST remain latched through its exit even when caller state changes the live edge prop during close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Current exit-side test and implementation                        | Verified current behavior                                                                                |
| FR3  | The desktop inline-size budget MUST accept pixel numbers or CSS lengths and remain bounded by the viewport. At or below 640px, page-reveal mode MUST preserve 56px and use `width` as a cap; full-mobile mode MUST override `width` with `100dvw`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Current docs, styles, and width tests                            | Verified current behavior                                                                                |
| FR4  | Visibility through Drawer-owned behavior MUST follow `isOpen`. Uncanceled Escape routed by the shared stack and uncanceled modal-backdrop activation request `false` when `purpose` allows (FR15), and a `DrawerHeader` close action requests `false` through the callback it is given; Drawer prevents its handled native `cancel` event from closing the dialog directly. During controlled exit, Drawer keeps its host and content region mounted while rendering the caller's current `children`.                                | Current prop contract and lifecycle tests                        | Verified for Drawer-owned paths; direct native mutation through the public ref is outside this guarantee |
| FR5  | At open time, `hasScrim={true}` MUST select native `showModal()` with `aria-modal`, a focus trap, body scroll locking, and a visible backdrop; `hasScrim={false}` MUST select a manual Popover API host that leaves the page behind interactive. Changing `hasScrim` while open is not a supported native-mode transition.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Current source, docs, and initial-mode tests                     | Initial modes verified; live presentation changes unsupported                                            |
| FR6  | An uncanceled modal root/backdrop click (`target === currentTarget` while live `hasScrim` is true) MUST request close when `purpose` is `info`, and MUST NOT for `form` or `required`. Descendant clicks and dialog-root clicks while live `hasScrim` is false MUST NOT request close, and non-modal presentation MUST NOT install an invisible outside-pointer dismissal plane.                                                                                                                                                     | Current click tests                                              | Verified current behavior                                                                                |
| FR7  | Drawer MUST NOT render a close control of its own. `DrawerHeader` MUST render a close action with an accessible name only when `onOpenChange` is passed and call it with `false` without taking open-state ownership. It renders its title as an h2 and neither moves focus on mount nor names the Drawer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | DEC-1; close-control and `DrawerHeader.test.tsx` suites          | Owner decision (DEC-1); pending approval                                                                 |
| FR8  | Opening MUST present the native host, capture the element focused before opening, and attempt to focus the first rendered `[data-autofocus]` descendant, if any. After a completed controlled close releases the native host, Drawer MUST attempt to restore focus to the captured element. The non-modal host's synthetic `close` event MUST dispatch after that restore attempt — matching the task-queued native `dialog.close()` event — so a consumer close listener keeps the last word on final focus.                        | Current presence hook and focus tests                            | Verified for completed controlled close                                                                  |
| FR9  | Closing MUST retain the panel host, content region, edge, and native presentation while the exit remains visible and continue rendering the caller's current `children`. The transform transition is authoritative, a computed-duration backstop prevents a lost event from stranding the host, and native release and React hiding land together so no frame paints outside the top layer.                                                                                                                                          | Current lifecycle tests and browser close-visibility guard       | Observable outcome verified                                                                              |
| FR10 | Sibling Drawers MUST be composed as siblings. The last-opened present sibling owns the first Escape request through the shared stack; a closing sibling retains that ownership through its visible exit, and reopening registers a new active cycle so one request never closes two surfaces. Paint order in both presentations follows the browser top layer's chronological order.                                                                                                                                                 | Current docs, shared stack, and tests                            | Verified current behavior                                                                                |
| FR11 | At this commit, `DrawerProps` extends `BaseProps<HTMLDialogElement>` and separately declares `ref`. The root filters `open`, merges `xstyle`, `className`, and `style`, forwards remaining unclaimed props, composes consumer `onClick`, forwards consumer `onKeyDown` ahead of the shared document-level Escape owner, and owns `aria-label`, `aria-modal`, `onCancel`, and, for a modal `required` drawer, `role="alertdialog"`. A consumer `onKeyDown` that prevents default cancels shared-stack Escape dismissal for the press. | Current source and focused keyboard tests                        | Recorded current Lab behavior; not a stable compatibility decision                                       |
| FR12 | At this commit, the painted root dialog emits the documented `drawer` target and `side` selector axis and applies the container-padding reset. `DrawerHeader` emits `drawer-header`, `drawer-header-start-content`, `drawer-header-title-block`, `drawer-header-end-content`, and `drawer-header-close-icon`, mirroring `DialogHeader`. No separate Drawer target is currently emitted for content or scrim; future target qualification remains owned by `architecture:component-theming-surface`.                                  | Current source, docs, and structural target metadata             | Current reachability only; no target-admission decision                                                  |
| FR13 | Drawer MUST join the shared dismissal stack for its full rendered lifetime, provide logical depth to descendant layers, route platform close through the same topmost/IME decision, and preserve consumer `preventDefault()` ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Shared family contract and focused tests                         | Verified current conformance                                                                             |
| FR14 | Non-modal Drawer MUST use a manual Popover API host so cross-surface order comes from the browser top layer rather than a page-level z-index band. The reduced fallback may use `dialog.show()` only below the Popover API support floor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Current source, browser guard, and `spec:AST-027`                | Verified current conformance                                                                             |
| FR15 | `purpose` MUST match `component:Dialog`. `info` (default) lets Escape, platform close, and a modal scrim click request close; `form` lets Escape and platform close request close and ignores scrim clicks; `required` lets none request close, registers with the shared stack as `block` so the request does not reach a lower layer, and exposes a modal drawer as `role="alertdialog"`. Without a scrim, `form` and `info` behave the same.                                                                                      | DEC-1; purpose suite; `family:overlay-dismissal` Escape behavior | Owner decision (DEC-1); pending approval                                                                 |
| FR16 | The Content area pads caller content by the drawer's container inset, `--spacing-4` by default as in Dialog, and publishes the applied inset to descendants as a container publisher. Its block-end edge applies the container inset plus the home-indicator safe area while publishing the inset alone, so a bleed child subtracts only the inset and the safe area survives below it. The root dialog keeps the container-padding reset (FR12).                                                                                    | `architecture:container-padding`; container padding suite        | Candidate (DEC-2); prototype pending owner approval                                                      |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Caller content.** Any renderable inspector/detail content may occupy the
  scrolling content region without becoming Drawer-owned anatomy. Drawer renders
  current `children`; callers decide whether the underlying data remains available
  during exit.
- **AV2 — Inline size.** Consumers may choose the desktop budget within valid CSS
  and viewport constraints. It remains the cap in mobile page-reveal mode, while
  full-mobile mode uses `100dvw` instead.
- **AV3 — Presentation.** The value at native open selects the modal dialog or
  the non-modal popover host. Changing `hasScrim` while open is unsupported.
- **AV4 — Close control.** Callers choose whether to render a close action,
  normally `DrawerHeader` with `onOpenChange`, or their own control.
- **AV6 — Dismissal purpose.** Callers choose `info`, `form`, or `required`.
- **AV5 — Motion duration.** Themes may alter the transform transition duration;
  close timing follows computed CSS and reduced-motion preferences.

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD0 — Content inset.** The `padding` prop, then the theme's `padding`
  properties on `drawer`, then `--spacing-4`, as in Dialog. The block-end
  safe-area inset is added after that resolution in every mode.
- **ORD1 — Open.** Resolve the current logical edge and width, retain the rendered
  panel, capture the currently focused element, use current `hasScrim` to select
  the native host, then honor a rendered autofocus destination.
- **ORD2 — Close.** During controlled close, Drawer keeps its panel and
  caller-provided content visible through the exit animation. Transition
  completion or the computed-duration backstop releases the native host and hides
  React output together, so presentation ends without an intermediate visible
  frame; Drawer then attempts to restore focus to the previously focused element
  when available. The non-modal host's synthetic `close` event dispatches only
  after that restore attempt, so a consumer close listener that retargets focus
  observes the same last-word ordering as the task-queued native event.
- **ORD3 — Sibling order.** Sibling order comes from the shared dismissal stack
  and the browser top layer: the last-opened present sibling is frontmost and
  handles Escape first in both presentations. Descendant overlays remain governed
  by their own component and family contracts rather than Drawer nesting.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — Exit-only resources.** Transition listeners and the backstop timer exist
  only while close is waiting for the visible transform exit and are removed on
  completion, interruption, or unmount.
- **PR2 — Presentation cleanup.** Native presentation and any active body scroll
  lock exist only for their active states and are released on controlled close,
  unmount, or hidden Activity cleanup.
- **PR3 — Viewport-relative sizing.** Drawer derives sizing from `width`,
  `isFullWidthOnMobile`, and the viewport; callers do not supply a regional
  measurement target.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Name.** `label` is a required string forwarded to `aria-label`; caller
  content is not used as an implicit name. Current code does not reject an empty
  or whitespace-only value.
- **AR2 — Modal truthfulness.** At open time, `hasScrim={true}` uses native modal
  dialog state and `aria-modal`; `hasScrim={false}` uses the non-modal popover
  host and omits `aria-modal`. A modal `required` drawer uses
  `role="alertdialog"`. Changing `hasScrim` while open is not a supported
  transition.
- **AR3 — Keyboard dismissal.** Escape requests close only for the topmost
  registered layer through the shared stack and only when `purpose` allows; a
  `required` drawer consumes it. A consumer `onKeyDown` that prevents default
  cancels that dismissal, and unrelated keys do not dismiss.
- **AR4 — Focus lifecycle.** Focus enters visible Drawer content through the
  documented autofocus/native path and, after a completed controlled close, Drawer
  attempts to restore focus to the element that was active when the Drawer opened.
- **AR5 — Close affordance.** Drawer provides no close control of its own. When
  rendered, the `DrawerHeader` close action keeps its translated accessible name
  and Button-owned keyboard/focus behavior in both presentations.
- **AR6 — Direction and motion.** Logical inset placement follows computed
  direction; slide-direction mirroring currently requires a `[dir="rtl"]`
  ancestor. Self-applied `dir="rtl"` and CSS-only direction do not trigger
  transform mirroring. Motion reduces under `prefers-reduced-motion` without
  changing the final state.

| Content region   | Provides full-height scrolling and the container inset for caller-owned inspector content.                             | Current source and public docs     | Prominent      | FR4, FR16, AV1     |
| Header           | `DrawerHeader` supplies the title row and, when given `onOpenChange`, the close action.                                | `component:Button`, `LayoutHeader` | Supporting     | FR7, FR12, AR5     |
| Modal scrim      | At initial modal open, communicates the scrim-backed presentation and provides root-click activation behind the panel. | Current source and public docs     | Supporting     | FR5, FR6, AR2      |
| Page reveal      | Preserves overlay context on narrow viewports unless full coverage is requested.                                       | Current public docs                | Supporting     | FR3                |

The root Panel carries the current `drawer` target and reflects `side`, and
`DrawerHeader` carries its five `drawer-header` targets. No separate Drawer target
is currently reachable for Content region or Modal scrim. This draft does not
decide future target qualification.

## Family and system relationships

- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns cross-component Escape and platform-close
  ordering. Drawer participates through the shared owner for its rendered
  lifetime and supplies logical depth to descendant layers.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns the distinction between native modal hosting,
  non-modal dialog presentation, top-layer behavior, and shared layer plumbing.
- `architecture:public-component-api` owns stable API admission and compatibility.
  Drawer remains experimental in Lab; FR11 records current DOM/ref/event
  reachability without making a stable compatibility decision.
- `architecture:react-component-runtime` owns effect/resource cleanup, native-host
  synchronization, and node/lifecycle safety. This draft records Drawer-owned
  visible close and focus-handoff outcomes.
- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns target qualification and future
  anatomy mapping; this draft records the existing `drawer` target only.
- `architecture:container-padding` owns the shared container inset protocol.
  Admitting the Content area as a container publisher (FR16) amends that
  `current` record — an owner-approved change outside this draft.
- `spec:AST-027/DEC-3` requires equivalent floating interactions to use an
  applicable native top-layer host. Modal `showModal()` and non-modal manual
  Popover hosting satisfy that cross-surface route; the documented reduced
  fallback remains below the Popover API support floor.

## Decision log

- **DEC-1 — Align the close control and dismissal policy with Dialog** (owner
  decision, 2026-10-01). Drawer drops its built-in close button and
  `hasCloseButton`, adopts Dialog's `purpose` values and default, and adds
  `DrawerHeader` with `DialogHeader`'s API, so a close action lives in the header
  only when `onOpenChange` is passed. A Drawer-owned header, rather than reusing
  `DialogHeader`, keeps Drawer's focus entry (`data-autofocus` after native
  presentation) and `label` naming and avoids `dialog-header` theme targets.
  Rejected: keeping the built-in button and hiding it only for `required`;
  reusing `DialogHeader`; removing the button with no header.

- **DEC-2 — Drawer is a container, like Dialog** (owner decision,
  2026-10-08). The scrolling Content area becomes a container publisher with
  Dialog's contract: a `padding` prop on Dialog's spacing-step scale, theme
  `padding` on `drawer` expanded to `--astryx-drawer-padding*` container
  tokens, and a `--spacing-4` default that the edge and Layout inset chains
  share, exactly as in Dialog. Headers compose as in Dialog: `DrawerHeader`
  sits in a `Layout` header slot, and the Layout redistributes the inset to its
  regions, so the header is not inset twice. The block-end edge adds the
  home-indicator safe area on top of the inset in every mode. Rejected
  candidates: padding the panel root (the panel is the overlay boundary, and
  padding there bleeds under the anchored-side border); keeping the released
  full-bleed default, as BottomSheet does (diverges from Dialog).

## Open questions

- Should `DrawerHeader` supply a default focus target and name the Drawer through
  `aria-labelledby`, as `DialogHeader` does for Dialog? Today `label` is required
  and focus entry uses `data-autofocus`.
- Should an explicit `padding` prop keep adding the block-end safe area
  (DEC-2), or adopt Dialog's fullscreen rule, where an explicit value replaces
  the safe-area fallback entirely?

Regional placement, independent modality/scrim axes, and block-axis sheets
are outside the current component boundary. Any future proposal for them requires
fresh public-API and design authority rather than being inferred from this
current-state backfill.
