#### Fixes

- Keep PostCSS and Vite processing inside `@astryxdesign/build`'s declared dependency boundary (#6605)
  Packed consumers no longer depend on workspace hoisting to find PostCSS helpers or CSS compatibility processors. The package now owns Autoprefixer, Browserslist, and Lightning CSS, and a clean isolated-install test exercises the published tarball's PostCSS helper and Vite output.
- Make source builds fail on unsupported StyleX declarations and load shared StyleX output from every Vite HTML entry.
  Nested pseudo-elements and `stylex.keyframes()` now have production-build regression coverage, and the maintained capability registry tracks the installed StyleX version.

#### Fixes

- `withAstryx()` refuses a Turbopack config instead of building an unstyled app. Every alias the helper installs lives in `nextConfig.webpack`, which Turbopack never calls, so the app resolved `@astryxdesign/*` to dist while PostCSS compiled the library from source — disjoint class names, an exit code of 0, and an unstyled page. It now throws, naming both ways out: `--webpack`, or drop the helper and consume the pre-built package. Also warns when the merged alias map claims none of the packages, which reaches the same unstyled state by another route. (#6109)

#### Fixes

- `withAstryx()` now resolves an app's own `@astryxdesign/*` imports to the packages' `source` entries. The scoped webpack rule only governs requests issued from inside `node_modules`, so app code resolved the library through `default` to `dist` while PostCSS compiled it from source — the two emit disjoint class names and the app rendered unstyled without erroring.

#### Fixes

- Vite build: Astryx and product styles are split into their own cascade layers, so a theme's component overrides apply in a production build (#5410)
  StyleX emits every rule it collects into one top-level `@layer priority1…priorityN`. The dev server re-served those partitioned by source file — Astryx's own styles into `astryx-base`, the app's into `product` — but a build did neither, so the priority layers landed outside the `@layer reset, astryx-base, astryx-theme, product` order and outranked all of it. Every `components: {…}` override a theme set — a colour, a radius, a public custom property — was silently dropped in the built app while working in dev.

  The build now runs the same partition the dev server does, from the same helper, so the promised order holds in both: Astryx's styles are overridable by a theme, and an app's own styles still outrank everything.

#### Fixes

- build: import `node:fs` statically so the Vite plugin's package discovery survives the ESM build (#4972)
  `astryxStylex()`'s config plugin discovered installed `@astryxdesign/*` packages with `require('node:fs')`. The `./vite` export ships only an ESM bundle (`dist/vite.mjs`, esbuild `format: 'esm'`), where esbuild lowers `require` to a shim that throws `Dynamic require of "node:fs" is not supported` — always, since native `require` never exists under ESM. The surrounding `try/catch` swallowed the throw, so `optimizeDeps.exclude` silently fell back to `['@astryxdesign/core']` and every other installed Astryx package stayed eligible for Vite pre-bundling, which strips `stylex.create`/`defineVars` calls and causes runtime errors.

  The discovery now uses a static `import fs from 'node:fs'`, which esbuild preserves as a real ESM import. A regression test compiles `vite.ts` with the same esbuild options as `build.mjs` and runs the discovery in a child `node` process, since in-process test runners provide a `require` shim that masks the bug.

#### Fixes

- Scope the `source` resolve condition to @astryxdesign packages in withAstryx
  `withAstryx` set webpack's `conditionNames` to `['source', …]` globally, which resolved _any_ dependency shipping a `source` export to its raw TypeScript — not just Astryx packages. Third-party deps that ship a `source` export (e.g. `lexical`, pulled in by the new RichTextEditor lab component) were then fed untranspiled `.ts` through Next's babel and failed on syntax like `declare` class fields.

#### Breaking Changes

- Rename `@xds/build` exports off the xds name
  The Vite integration's public exports are renamed: `xdsStylex` -> `astryxStylex`,
  and the option types `XDSVitePluginOptions` / `XDSVitePluginLegacyOptions` ->
  `AstryxVitePluginOptions` / `AstryxVitePluginLegacyOptions`. Update imports from
  `@xds/build/vite` accordingly. Internal plugin names and the babel wrapper are
  also rebranded. Part of removing `xds` naming from the public API.
- Rename Next.js helper `withXDS` to `withAstryx`
  The Next.js configuration wrapper is renamed `withXDS` -> `withAstryx`
  (exported from `@astryxdesign/build/next`). Update your `next.config.mjs`:
  `import {withAstryx} from '@astryxdesign/build/next'`. Part of removing xds
  naming from the public API.

# 0.1.0

#### Breaking Changes

- Default the StyleX library atomic-class prefix to `astryx` (was `xds`)
  `@astryxdesign/build`'s babel/Vite integrations now emit library atomic classes as
  `.astryx78zum5` by default instead of `.xds78zum5` (the `libraryPrefix` /
  `stylexPrefix` option default flips `xds` -> `astryx`). This is an opaque,
  StyleX-generated namespace — consumers don't target these classes directly —
  but it completes the removal of `xds` naming from build output. Consumers that
  explicitly configured `libraryPrefix`/`stylexPrefix` are unaffected.
- Remove the XDS-prefix compatibility layer — astryx is now the only public surface
  This release erases all `xds` naming from the public API; there is no compatibility
  window. Consumers must migrate (we own all consumers pre-OSS):
- Remove the daily, brutalist, and default themes; neutral is the new baseline
  Three theme packages are removed from the repo and will no longer be published:

#### Other Changes

- **Component names:** the `XDS*` aliases are gone — use bare names (`Button` not
  `XDSButton`, `useTheme` not `useXDSTheme`, `ButtonProps` not `XDSButtonProps`). The
  `drop-xds-prefix-imports` codemod automates this.
- **CSS classes:** components emit only `.astryx-*` (the dual `.xds-*` class is gone).
  Update custom CSS selectors `.xds-button` -> `.astryx-button` (prop/state value classes
  like `.primary`/`.sm` are unchanged).
- **data attributes:** only `data-astryx-theme` / `data-astryx-media` are written; update
  custom selectors and SSR root attributes off `data-xds-*`.
- **CSS layers:** `@layer xds-base` / `xds-theme` are renamed to `astryx-base` /
  `astryx-theme`; update your `@layer` order line and any PostCSS `layersBefore` config.
  `@astryxdesign/build`'s default library layer is now `astryx-base`.
- **Pre-compiled stylesheet:** the `@astryxdesign/core/xds.css` export is removed — import
  `@astryxdesign/core/astryx.css`.
- **CSS custom properties:** the `--xds-*` padding fallback is gone; set `--astryx-*`.
- **CLI config key:** `@astryxdesign/cli` reads the package.json `"astryx"` field (was `"xds"`).
  Rename the block; a stale `"xds"` key silently drops the package from discovery.
- `@astryxdesign/theme-daily`
- `@astryxdesign/theme-brutalist`
- `@astryxdesign/theme-default`
- import {defaultTheme} from '@astryxdesign/theme-default/built';
  - import {neutralTheme} from '@astryxdesign/theme-neutral/built';
- <Theme theme={defaultTheme}>...</Theme>
  - <Theme theme={neutralTheme}>...</Theme>

  ```

  ```

- Rename the npm package scope from `@xds/*` to `@astryxdesign/*`
  All published packages move to the new `@astryxdesign` scope (e.g. `@xds/core` → `@astryxdesign/core`), along with the workspace lockfile, build/runtime scope-directory scans, and docsite slug derivation. Consumers must update their imports and dependency names. The internal ESLint plugin namespace (`@xds/*` rules) is intentionally untouched and tracked separately. Existing `@xds/*` codemods continue to target the old scope so projects still on `@xds/*` can migrate.
