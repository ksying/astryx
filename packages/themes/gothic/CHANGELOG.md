# @xds/theme-gothic

# 0.6.6

#### New Features

- Add a shared `upload` icon, and use it for FileInput's upload affordance instead of the directional `arrowUp`
  Themes draw `upload` through `icons.upload`, separately from `arrowUp`, so sort arrows and every other `arrowUp` use stay unchanged. Every bundled theme and theme template draws `upload` in its own icon style. FileInput keeps its icon size, placement, color, and accessibility in both modes; a theme with no `upload` artwork shows the default upload-into-tray glyph there.

  A complete `IconRegistry` may still omit `upload` in this release. The next minor makes it required, so add an `upload` entry to any registry you type as `IconRegistry`.

#### Fixes

- Theme packages no longer ship an unused CommonJS `icons.js` artifact. Their root entry keeps its advertised CommonJS and ESM outputs, while the standalone icon companion used by `/built` is emitted only as `icons.mjs`. (#5512)

#### Fixes

- The `/built` entry now loads under Node ESM and externalized SSR (Vite `--ssr`, Remix / React Router v7): it imports `./icons.mjs` instead of the extensionless `./icons` Node cannot resolve.

# 0.4.2

#### Fixes

- `--radius-none` no longer overrides to `0.125rem`. `--radius-none` and `--radius-full` are documented as always fixed (never scaled by a theme), matching `@astryxdesign/core`'s own defaults — each of these themes' radius group bumps swept `--radius-none` along with it by mistake, the same bug fixed for `theme-neutral` in #4856. Anything opting out of rounding via `--radius-none` under these themes now renders with a true `0px` radius again, instead of a silent 2px.
