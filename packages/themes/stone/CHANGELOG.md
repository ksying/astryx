# @xds/theme-stone

# 0.6.6

#### New Features

- Add a shared `upload` icon, and use it for FileInput's upload affordance instead of the directional `arrowUp`
  Themes draw `upload` through `icons.upload`, separately from `arrowUp`, so sort arrows and every other `arrowUp` use stay unchanged. Every bundled theme and theme template draws `upload` in its own icon style. FileInput keeps its icon size, placement, color, and accessibility in both modes; a theme with no `upload` artwork shows the default upload-into-tray glyph there.

  A complete `IconRegistry` may still omit `upload` in this release. The next minor makes it required, so add an `upload` entry to any registry you type as `IconRegistry`.

#### Fixes

- Prefer canonical component target names in maintained themes and new examples while preserving deprecated runtime aliases and released bare prop/state selector classes through the 0.7.0 removal window. Theme discovery labels deprecated targets, theme build warns with each exact canonical replacement, and `astryx upgrade --apply` provides the forward-compatible bare-selector migration. (#6126)

- Stone theme: move `--color-text-secondary` to the canonical T40/T70 pair so normal secondary text meets WCAG AA across the theme's light and dark consumer surfaces (#5505) (#5509)
- Theme packages no longer ship an unused CommonJS `icons.js` artifact. Their root entry keeps its advertised CommonJS and ESM outputs, while the standalone icon companion used by `/built` is emitted only as `icons.mjs`. (#5512)

- The `/built` entry now loads under Node ESM and externalized SSR (Vite `--ssr`, Remix / React Router v7): it imports `./icons.mjs` instead of the extensionless `./icons` Node cannot resolve.

# 0.4.2

#### Fixes

- `--radius-none` no longer overrides to `0.125rem`. `--radius-none` and `--radius-full` are documented as always fixed (never scaled by a theme), matching `@astryxdesign/core`'s own defaults — each of these themes' radius group bumps swept `--radius-none` along with it by mistake, the same bug fixed for `theme-neutral` in #4856. Anything opting out of rounding via `--radius-none` under these themes now renders with a true `0px` radius again, instead of a silent 2px.

#### Fixes

- Stone theme: dark-mode overlay/accent-muted tokens missing alpha (#3624)
  The dark-mode values for `--color-accent-muted`, `--color-overlay-hover`, and `--color-overlay-pressed` were fully opaque `#f3f3f5`, unlike their light-mode counterparts which are semi-transparent tints. Because these tokens paint absolutely-positioned hover/press overlays and muted-accent fills, the opaque dark value covered the content underneath instead of tinting it. Changed the dark values to carry alpha suffixes following the conventions used by every other theme in the repo: overlays symmetric with light (`#f3f3f50d` hover / `#f3f3f51a` pressed, matching butter/chocolate/matcha/neutral/y2k), and accent-muted one step stronger in dark (`#f3f3f520`, matching the `14`-light/`20`-dark pattern in chocolate/matcha/y2k). Fixes #3622.
- Stone theme: restore dark-mode alpha for overlay/border/shadow tokens (#3626)
  The dark-mode values for `--color-overlay`, `--color-border`, and `--color-shadow` were fully opaque (`#28282a`, `#f3f3f5`, `#000000`), unlike their light-mode counterparts and their own original pre-regression values, which are semi-transparent tints. An opaque overlay hides the page behind a solid block instead of a translucent scrim, an opaque border paints a solid near-white line instead of a subtle hairline, and an opaque shadow has no falloff. Restored the exact values from Stone's introduction (30e9d122f, #2020), stripped by a later tooling pass (e2892c0ad, #2173): `--color-overlay` to `#28282acc` (80%), `--color-border` to `#f3f3f51a` (T96 · 10%), and `--color-shadow` to `#0000004d` (30%). Fixes #3625.

#### Fixes

- Stone theme: add ~10% transparency to dark-mode `--color-neutral`
  The dark-mode value was a fully opaque `#f3f3f5`, unlike every other theme which uses a semi-transparent (~10% alpha) neutral tint. Because `--color-neutral` fills the secondary `Button` variant, this rendered a solid near-white surface with near-white text in dark mode (unreadable). Changed dark value to `#f3f3f51a` to match the convention used across all other themes. Fixes #3119.
