# @xds/theme-neutral

# 0.6.6

#### New Features

- Add a shared `upload` icon, and use it for FileInput's upload affordance instead of the directional `arrowUp`
  Themes draw `upload` through `icons.upload`, separately from `arrowUp`, so sort arrows and every other `arrowUp` use stay unchanged. Every bundled theme and theme template draws `upload` in its own icon style. FileInput keeps its icon size, placement, color, and accessibility in both modes; a theme with no `upload` artwork shows the default upload-into-tray glyph there.

  A complete `IconRegistry` may still omit `upload` in this release. The next minor makes it required, so add an `upload` entry to any registry you type as `IconRegistry`.

#### New Features

- Ship a typed `ThemeDoc` descriptor beside each first-party theme source. (#6498)

#### Documentation

- Describe Neutral as Figtree typography and add the font-loading snippet; the README claimed system fonts while the theme declares Figtree. (#5991)

#### Fixes

- Prefer canonical component target names in maintained themes and new examples while preserving deprecated runtime aliases and released bare prop/state selector classes through the 0.7.0 removal window. Theme discovery labels deprecated targets, theme build warns with each exact canonical replacement, and `astryx upgrade --apply` provides the forward-compatible bare-selector migration. (#6126)

# 0.6.0

#### Breaking Changes

- Requires `@astryxdesign/core@0.6.0` as part of the coordinated stable release. Upgrade Core and this theme together.

#### New Features

- Add an authoring-time OKLCH palette generator with a pure API, terminal and HTML previews, typed palette output, custom stops, deterministic receipts, and overwrite protection.
  [feat] Expose exact solid black and white values as `neutralPalettes.black` and `neutralPalettes.white` for use in semantic theme tokens.

#### Fixes

- Align Neutral light-mode foreground colors to darker palette stops.

#### New Components

- Reuse Neutral-owned local tokens for semantic status fills across badges, status dots, step indicators, and progress bars. (#5854)
- Add Neutral's reproducible, theme-owned OKLCH palette without changing
  its runtime token mappings. The request, receipt, generated result, and CLI template artifacts are committed together for review. (#5987)

#### New Features

- Mute the low-tone edge of Neutral's dark chromatic palette while preserving its light and neutral ramps. (#6069)

#### Fixes

- Correct Neutral Banner interaction tints so light mode uses translucent light overlays and dark mode uses translucent dark overlays. (#5936)
- Use palette-backed red interaction overlays for Neutral destructive
  buttons, solid dark-palette tone-25 backgrounds (tone 20 for gray), and calmer dark-mode text colors. Use a palette-backed muted blue tint for dark info banners while preserving the existing light-mode non-semantic color mappings. (#6049)
- Give Neutral segmented controls a roomier inset while preserving their outside height. (#5851)
- Rename built-in syntax theme identifiers. (#5847)
- Remap Neutral's semantic, syntax, and categorical color tokens to the
  reviewed theme-owned palette through named stop references. Keep the maintained CLI template synchronized. (#6034)

- Theme packages no longer ship an unused CommonJS `icons.js` artifact. Their root entry keeps its advertised CommonJS and ESM outputs, while the standalone icon companion used by `/built` is emitted only as `icons.mjs`. (#5512)

#### Fixes

- neutral theme: darken the light-mode error red from `#e33f4a` to `#c9303a` so the filled `Badge variant="error"` label clears WCAG 2.1 AA. White on `#e33f4a` is 4.14:1 and the badge label is 12px/weight 500, so the 4.5:1 normal-text threshold applies rather than the 3:1 large-text allowance; `#c9303a` gives 5.29:1 while holding the hue (OKLCH H 21.9 -> 22.8, C 0.200 -> 0.189). StatusDot and the ProgressBar `--color-error` rebinding move with it — both are documented as tracking the badge fill so the dot and its badge read as one status language. Dark mode is untouched (dark text on `#ff705d`, 6.60:1). Adds `scripts/check-badge-contrast.test.mjs`, which resolves every theme's badge label/fill pair through `light-dark()`, `var()` indirection and alpha compositing, and holds all of them to 4.5:1 (#4446).

#### Fixes

- Banner: a dismissed banner no longer drops focus, a custom status no longer loses its ARIA role, and the info banner paints again under the neutral theme.
  Dismissing unmounted the focused dismiss button, so focus landed on `<body>` and a keyboard user lost their place in the page. Banner now records where focus entered from and returns it there, the same handoff `ToastViewport` makes for a dismissed toast. Measured in Chromium: `document.activeElement` was `BODY`, and is now the control the user tabbed in from.

  `BannerStatusMap` is documented as augmentable, but all four status lookups were closed `Record<BannerStatus, ...>` maps. Adding the augmentation the docs show produced four TypeScript errors inside `Banner.tsx` itself, which a consumer cannot fix, and at runtime an unknown status resolved to `undefined` for its icon, its background and its ARIA role, so the banner stopped being a live region at all. The lookups are partial now: an unrecognized status renders with no status fill, no default glyph and `role="status"`.

  A theme could not reach the banner's radius. `--_banner-radius` was declared in the doc file and in `derivedVarRegistry.ts`, but no rule read it, so a theme's `borderRadius` on the `banner` target expanded into a variable nothing consumed. The four card-silhouette radii read it now, falling back to `--radius-container`.

  Under `@astryxdesign/theme-neutral` the info banner had no background at all, light or dark: the override set `background-color` directly and forced `--color-accent-muted` to `transparent`, and a plain CSS property written by a theme lands in `@layer astryx-theme`, which StyleX's `@layer priority4` outranks. Info now goes through `--color-accent-muted` like the other three statuses and like the stone theme already did.

  Also in this change: `children={false}` (the ordinary `{cond && <ul/>}` idiom) no longer produces an expand toggle that opens an empty box, and `description=""` no longer leaves an empty 20px row, both via `isRenderable`; a long unbroken word in the title or description no longer forces the page into horizontal scrolling at a 320px viewport, measured at `document.scrollWidth` 529px before; and the content area's bottom border uses logical `border-block-end` alongside its inline siblings.

- The `/built` entry now loads under Node ESM and externalized SSR (Vite `--ssr`, Remix / React Router v7): it imports `./icons.mjs` instead of the extensionless `./icons` Node cannot resolve.

#### Fixes

- `--radius-none` no longer overrides to `0.25rem`. `--radius-none` and `--radius-full` are documented as always fixed (never scaled by a theme), matching `@astryxdesign/core`'s own defaults — this theme's radius group bump swept `--radius-none` along with it by mistake. Anything opting out of rounding via `--radius-none` under this theme now renders with a true `0px` radius again, instead of a silent 4px. (#4856)

#### Fixes

- neutral theme: darken light-mode `--color-text-secondary` from neutral-500 (#737373) to neutral-600 (#525252). 500 only reached 4.19:1 on the T95 body background (#f1f1f1), just under WCAG AA 1.4.3 (4.5:1); 600 clears it. Dark mode is unchanged.

#### Fixes

- Neutral theme: express the light `--color-border` as `#00000014` (translucent black) instead of the opaque `#ebebeb`. Same rendered color over a white surface, but it now blends over any background — matching the translucent dark-mode value.

#### Fixes

- StatusDot now uses the same vivid fills as the filled Badge in the neutral theme. Previously the dots mapped to the dark text/icon stops (dark green, maroon, brown), which read muddy in light mode; success/warning/error/accent now match their badge counterparts so a dot and its badge share one status color.
