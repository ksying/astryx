// mutation-checked there (restoring the old `searchQuery === ''` condition
// fails it and nothing else).
//
// A browser version was written and withdrawn. Its step assertions showed the
// query surviving, the panel open, and zero options, with the empty message
// absent — which `renderOptions` produces only while `isLoading` is true. The
// story's `setLoaded(true)` never reached the mounted instance, so the
// component never left loading and was correct to render nothing. That is a
// story-harness problem, not a component one, and chasing it through CI (the
// authoring machine cannot launch Chromium) was costing more than the
// scenario's incremental browser coverage is worth.
