/**
 * @file useRenamedProp.ts
 * @input The component name, the old and new prop names, and both values
 * @output The value to use, with development warnings for the overlap
 * @position Core deprecation utility; the replacement-first half of a prop
 *   rename
 *
 * A released prop is a public promise, so a rename ships the replacement
 * first and keeps the old name working through the overlap (`spec:AST-017`
 * FR28–FR29, `architecture:public-component-api` INV9). This centralizes the
 * two things every such overlap owes: the new name wins when both are set,
 * and development says so rather than letting a caller wonder which one the
 * component read.
 *
 * Production behavior is unchanged either way — a warning is a builder
 * guardrail, never shipped noise (`spec:AST-017` FR29).
 *
 * SYNC: deliberately NOT exported from /packages/core/src/hooks/index.ts —
 * that barrel is re-exported wholesale from the package entry point, so
 * adding it there would ship a new public hook without `spec:AST-002`
 * admission. Import it by path from inside the package.

 * Resolve a renamed prop: the replacement wins, the old name still works,
 * and development warns on use of the old name and again when both are set.
 *
 * `null` and `undefined` both count as "not given", matching the `??` the
 * adopting components already apply to their own defaults — so an explicit
 * `null` replacement falls through to the deprecated value if there is one,
 * and otherwise to the component's default, without a both-are-set warning
 * for a value that was never really set. An empty string is different: it is
 * a deliberate "render nothing" and wins like any other value.
 *
 * Returns `undefined` when neither is given, so the caller still applies its
 * own default.
 *
 * @example
 * ```
 * const emptySearchText = useRenamedProp({
 *   component: 'Tokenizer',
 *   deprecated: 'emptySearchResultsText',
 *   deprecatedValue: emptySearchResultsText,
 *   replacement: 'emptySearchText',
 *   value: emptySearchTextFromProps,
 * });
 * ```
