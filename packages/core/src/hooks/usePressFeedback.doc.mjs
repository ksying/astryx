      'The touch press model every Astryx pressable uses, for a local component that paints its own press. Under a finger, CSS `:active` paints on the touch itself and can outlive the start of a scroll; the press model instead waits 150 ms before believing a press, cancels it the moment the finger travels 10 px or a scroll claims the gesture, never brings it back inside that gesture, answers a quick tap at the lift, and fades the release over 200 ms — the clocks a native list uses. One document-level controller does this for every marked element (installed by the first pressable to mount, removed by the last to unmount), so calling the hook adds no listener or state to your element. Under a mouse nothing changes: keep your `:active` rule, and drop it under `@media (pointer: coarse)` the way the built-in components do.',
