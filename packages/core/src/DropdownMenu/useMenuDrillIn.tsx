 * @file useMenuDrillIn.tsx
 * @input React, StyleX, the shared SSR-safe media-query check
 * @output Exports useMenuDrillIn — the view stack a menu root keeps so its
 *   sub-menus can drill in — and the coarse-pointer query.
 * @position Internal; mounted by DropdownMenu and ContextMenu, read by
 *   DropdownMenuSubMenu through DropdownMenuContext.
 *
 * On a phone a flyout beside a phone-width menu has no room, so a sub-menu
 * row replaces the list with its own rows and a Back row in the same menu
 * box. The root owns the stack: `wrapContent` renders the root's rows inside
 * a wrapper that hides while a view shows, followed by the host element the
 * shown view portals its rows into. The sub-menu row stays mounted (hidden)
 * while its view shows, so its rows stay live and Back can return focus to
 * it without bookkeeping. Whether a finger drove the menu is decided once,
 * when it opens, so a menu never changes shape under a pointer.
