# MultiSelector component contract

## Intent

MultiSelector renders a multi-selection control with an optional standalone Field
shell and one shared panel content tree in either an anchored pointer popup or a
touch-oriented BottomSheet. It also supports a read-only state that preserves and
submits the selected values without exposing that panel or an editing affordance.
This draft records current consumer anatomy, theming ownership, and read-only
behavior.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- `isReadOnly` is additive and defaults to `false`. It preserves selected values,
  focus, and form participation while removing selection-surface and editing
  affordances. `isDisabled` takes precedence when both are set.
- Existing DOM, styling, targets, and public API remain unchanged when the prop is
  omitted.
- `renderTrigger`, `handleRef`, and `onOpenChange` are additive and absent by
  default. When omitted, DOM, styling, targets, keyboard behavior, and public
  API remain unchanged. With `renderTrigger`, the caller-rendered control replaces
  the Field shell and Trigger by the caller's choice, not as a change to the
  released default.
- `hasCreate` is additive and off by default. `onChange` gains an optional
  second argument, a `MultiSelectorChange` descriptor, passed only for a
  creation; a one-argument handler keeps working. When `hasCreate` is omitted,
  DOM, styling, targets, keyboard behavior, announcements, and the callback's
  calls are unchanged.
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged. Open state stays owned by the
  component; `handleRef` drives it and `onOpenChange` reports it.
- Migration decision: none

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The painted Trigger and its current `multi-selector` target.
- Indicator icon, Search row, Option row, Section heading, Empty state, and
  Pointer popup presentation through the other six current MultiSelector targets.
- One shared panel-content tree containing optional search, option, divider,
  section, and empty-state content regardless of which presentation hosts it.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Standalone field-shell presentation — rendered by Field and themed through
  Field's current `field` target; omitted when MultiSelector is inside InputGroup.
- Shared clear actions — rendered by Field's InputClearButton and themed through
  Field's current `input-clear-button` target.
- Option checkbox presentation — rendered by CheckboxInput and themed through
  CheckboxInput's current `checkbox-indicator` target.
- Public option dividers — rendered by Divider and themed through Divider's
  current `divider` target.
- General Icon presentation for start, search, and status icons — rendered by
  Icon and themed through Icon's current `icon` target.
- The Touch sheet heading — rendered by Heading and themed through Text's current
  `heading` target.
- The Touch sheet panel — rendered by BottomSheet and themed through
  BottomSheet's current `bottom-sheet` target.
- Arbitrary ReactNode start content supplied by the caller.
- Shared layer lifecycle, positioning, and dismissal behavior.

## Public concepts

This table names the additive concept introduced by `spec:AST-011`. Complete prop
syntax and examples remain in `MultiSelector.doc.mjs`.

| Concept         | Closed values or states         | Meaning                                                                                             | Availability                                                | Default | Owner  | Stability | Invalid-value behavior                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| read-only state | `false`, `true`                 | Preserves and submits values without selection affordance                                           | Closed trigger                                              | `false` | Caller | additive  | Boolean normalization                                        |
| anchored mode   | `renderTrigger` absent, present | Caller-rendered control replaces Field shell and Trigger; panel anchored to it and named by `label` | Pointer popup and Touch sheet                               | absent  | Caller | additive  | Render prop must return the control carrying the given props |
| create row      | `hasCreate` `false`, `true`     | First row minting the typed query, reported through `onChange` as `{type: 'create', query}`         | Search mode, query matching no option label, options loaded | `false` | Caller | additive  | Without `hasSearch`: development warning, nothing offered    |

## Behavioral and layout contract

| ID            | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Basis                                                                                             | Draft review state                                 |

| FR10          | Once any declared option — at any depth of sections, before any query filters it — carries an `action`, the popup is a `role="grid"` and stays one while mounted; the trigger advertises `aria-haspopup="grid"` (the bottom sheet keeps `dialog`). Each option, the select-all row included, is a `role="row"` carrying the option's id, `aria-selected` and `aria-disabled`, with exactly two `gridcell` children: the option's content, then its action or an empty cell. A section is a `rowgroup` named by its title. Pressing the option cell toggles; pressing the action fires the caller's control and nothing else. Up/Down move rows onto the option cell; the inline-end arrow moves to the action cell and the inline-start arrow back, following visual direction under RTL; Enter on the action cell activates the control. `aria-activedescendant` names the row or the action cell. No control inside the popup is a tab stop. | `spec:AST-058` FR1–FR8, AR1–AR4                                                                   | Proposed; awaiting owner approval                  |

### Allowed variation

- Standalone MultiSelector renders Field; the supported InputGroup path omits it.
- `presentation="popover"` uses the Pointer popup; `presentation="bottom-sheet"`
  uses the Touch sheet and its Heading; `presentation="adaptive"` selects between
  those existing branches from current modality and viewport behavior.
- Search row, Option divider, Section heading, Empty state, select-all Option row,
  and both clear actions are optional under their documented prop and data conditions.
- Semantic names and icon component types render through Icon. Arbitrary ReactNode
  start content renders directly and stays caller-owned.
- Trigger text, labels, badges, and custom option content may vary inside the
  Trigger or Option row without creating another MultiSelector target.

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Standalone or InputGroup               | Field is present only standalone; Trigger anatomy and targets remain the same in both paths.                | InputGroup owns grouped layout and labeling support.                     |
| Pointer presentation                   | Pointer popup carries `multi-selector-popup` and hosts the shared panel content.                            | Search, groups, options, and empty content follow their ordinary states. |
| Touch presentation                     | BottomSheet owns the Sheet panel, Text owns its Heading, and the sheet hosts the same shared panel content. | Adaptive or explicit selection may choose this branch.                   |
| Search enabled with a query            | Search row owns `multi-selector-search`; its icons/actions keep their shared owners.                        | Results may be flat, grouped, or empty.                                  |
| Option, select all, selected, disabled | Option row owns `multi-selector-option` and reflects its current size/state metadata.                       | Checkbox state and custom row content vary independently.                |
| Attached or tooltip status             | Status icon replaces the Indicator icon.                                                                    | Tooltip status wraps the icon in a button without changing Icon owner.   |
| Read-only                              | Values stay focusable and submittable; panel, clear, and disclosure affordances are absent.                 | Trigger display, status, and busy presentation remain available.         |

### Transformation and precedence order

- No new search, selection, presentation, or styling precedence rule is introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new performance or resource rule is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

Existing field, combobox, listbox, checkbox, live-region, focus, and dismissal
behavior remains unchanged when editable. A read-only value stays focusable,
retains `role="combobox"`, and exposes `aria-readonly="true"` plus
`aria-expanded="false"`. Its rendered content remains the combobox value. It does
not expose `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`, or an active selection
surface. The implicit listbox popup describes the widget's selection capability;
read-only state communicates that its values cannot currently change. Chromium's
button-hosted combobox mapping omits the ARIA read-only property, so a localized
accessible description also announces that state. Search and non-search modes use
the same read-only combobox semantics because neither exposes a search control in
this state.

With `renderTrigger`, the caller's control carries `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`,
and `aria-controls` for the listbox, the listbox carries `aria-label` from
`label` instead of `aria-labelledby` the trigger, and the listbox is the
focused element that owns arrow, Enter, Escape, and typeahead keys while open,
so an anchor that cannot take focus still leaves a keyboard path.

The create row is a `role="option"` with `aria-selected="false"` and no
checkbox indicator. When it is the only result, the polite live region
announces its label rather than the empty-search message, so what is announced
matches what is on screen; picking it announces the creation.

The seven current MultiSelector targets remain on their shipped visible elements.
Nested shared primitives keep their own owners. The Pointer popup and Touch sheet
are intentionally separate rows because they use different surface owners; the
Touch sheet adds a Heading owned by Text. Search, option, divider, section, and
empty-state content remains one shared tree.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:public-component-api` and `spec:AST-011/DEC-1` own the additive
  read-only API and its cross-input meaning.
- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, local
  target mapping, delegation, and exclusion of deprecated aliases.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns the current Popover host and the distinction
  between browser popover and native-dialog sheet presentation.
- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns shared Escape and platform-close ordering. The
  Pointer popup participates through its composed Popover owner; the Touch sheet
  inherits BottomSheet's current local-only adoption gap.
- Field, CheckboxInput, Divider, Icon, Text, and BottomSheet retain ownership of
  their delegated targets and presentation.

Existing component tests directly assert the Trigger, Indicator icon, Search row,
Option row, Section heading, Empty state, and Pointer popup targets. Presentation
tests directly distinguish the Popover and BottomSheet branches. Source inspection
distinguishes standalone Field presence from InputGroup omission and confirms that both surface branches receive the same `panelContent`, while the touch branch
adds Heading; Divider, Text, BottomSheet, and other shared primitive tests provide
owner evidence rather than new MultiSelector targets.

## Decision log

- **DEC-1 — Anchored mode through `renderTrigger` + `handleRef`, not a controlled
  `isOpen`.** A picker anchored in a row the caller owns (a link row whose
  opener is a presentational glyph) cannot host the Field shell or a nested
  button. The caller renders the control and spreads the given props; the
  component keeps owning open state, and `handleRef`/`onOpenChange` open it
  from a keystroke elsewhere and report every change — the rule already written
  on `ComplexSelectorHandle`. Rejected: an `anchorRef` plus controlled
  `isOpen`, which mirrors open state in the parent and reintroduces the focus
  pitfalls that rule names.

  **Decider:** `cixzhang`, 2026-10-03

- **DEC-2 — The create row is one switch reporting through `onChange`.** The
  row exists only while a query does, so it is enabled by `hasCreate` alone
  and reported on the channel the caller already listens to, with a
  descriptor naming the creation and the typed text already in the value, so
  adding the option and accepting the value are one update (`spec:AST-056`
  DEC-3; the shape `Tokenizer` ships). The duplicate rule is the search's own
  matching rule at full equality: a label the filter shows as an exact match
  is never offered for creation, and one the filter cannot surface for the
  query is never a dead end. Nothing is offered while options are loading,
  because a label a moment from arriving is not new. Rejected: a `hasCreate` +
  `onCreate` pair (three silently inert half-configurations); offering the
  row while loading (mints duplicates); a diacritic-folding duplicate rule
  beside a case-only filter (hides `Café` from `CAFE` and refuses to create
  it — the two rules widen together under `spec:AST-056` FR4 or not at all).

  **Decider:** pending owner review
