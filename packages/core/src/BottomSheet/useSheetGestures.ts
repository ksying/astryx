 *
 * Drag + snap machinery for the bottom sheet. Tracks a pointer drag down the
 * block axis, translates the sliding surface live, and on release settles to
 * the detent nearest where the sheet would coast to at the finger's speed, or
 * dismisses when that is past the dismiss line. A slow drag projects onto
 * itself and places; a throw continues past the finger. This is the core
 * behavior split the sheet needs: DRAG places, SWIPE closes.
 *
 * A settled detent is split across two properties: `settledLayoutOffset` is
 * the part the scrolling area gives up as layout height, and the remainder is
 * a transform. Gestures and snaps only ever move the transform, so they stay
 * on the compositor; layout height changes at rest, in one transition-free
 * render whose visible geometry is identical. A peek detent — a stop that is
 * only a sliver of the sheet — keeps the full height and slides below the
 * viewport instead of reflowing to that sliver.
 *
 * A live drag writes that transform straight to the sheet element, once per
 * input sample, and renders nothing: React state changes when the drag begins
 * and ends, and in between only when the layout split changes (a drag that
 * crosses above its base detent restores the full height). The live offset
 * is readable through `activeOffsetRef`. The host owns the element's
 * transform outside a drag and writes the resting value after each commit,
 * so a settle animates from wherever the finger left the sheet.
 *
 * Those are pixels, and the stops behind them are relative to the viewport, so
 * a sheet at rest re-resolves its detent on `resize` / `orientationchange`,
 * and whenever the host swaps the snap points, and re-anchors to the new
 * geometry without animating. The detent it returns to is tracked by index:
 * the pixels stop meaning the same thing when the viewport changes, the stop
 * the user chose does not.
 *
 * On touch, the scrolling body hands the gesture to the sheet at a scroll
 * edge — once every scroller under the finger, a box nested inside the body
 * and the body itself, is at the edge the pull opposes (see
 * scrollChainUnder). Two shapes, because the browser only offers one of them
 * a choice: a
 * finger that lands on an edge and pulls away from it promotes by cancelling
 * the first, still-cancelable touchmove; a finger that scrolls INTO the end of
 * the content mid-gesture cannot, since the browser has committed the gesture
 * to scrolling and every remaining event is non-cancelable. The second shape
 * needs no cancelling — the scroller is clamped at its end, so there is
 * nothing left to scroll — and instead anchors at the point where the content
 * ran out and drives the sheet from the travel beyond it.
 *
 * Every gesture here is one finger. A second finger is a pinch, and pinch-zoom
 * belongs to the browser (WCAG 1.4.4): the surfaces declare `pinch-zoom` in
 * their `touch-action`, and a second finger — on either surface, in either
 * order — ends any drag in flight or armed (yieldToPinch), as does the
 * browser cancelling a handle drag to take the pinch. The sheet returns to
 * its detent and the pinch zooms the page.
 *
 * Kept private to BottomSheet: a dismiss edge + detents on a bottom-anchored
 * surface are inherently sheet concepts. It is not a general primitive and is
 * intentionally not exported.
 *
 * SSR-safe: no window/document access at module scope; all measurement
 * happens inside handlers. Respects prefers-reduced-motion by skipping the
 * settle transition.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update these files to stay in sync:
