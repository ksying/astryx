/**
 * @file pressGesture.ts
 * @input A press gesture's current phase and one pointer or timer event
 * @output Exports the press state machine (pressGestureStep, idlePressGesture),
 *   its clocks (PRESS_ONSET_MS, PRESS_SLOP_PX, PRESS_FLASH_MS, PRESS_FADE_MS,
 *   PRESS_SCROLL_BRAKE_MS) and their types
 * @position Pure half of the touch press model; driven by pressFeedback.ts,
 *   tested by pressGesture.test.ts without a browser
 *
 * WHAT A FINGER MEANS, AS A STATE MACHINE.
 *
 * A native (UIKit) list delays a press by 0.15 s, cancels it the instant a
 * scroll claims the gesture, never brings it back inside that gesture, and
 * fades it only on release. CSS `:active` on iOS Safari does none of those
 * things: measured on iOS 26.2, it paints within 14 ms of the touch and was
 * still painted 1.6 s into a scroll. So on a coarse pointer the pressed state
 * is owned here, in JavaScript, and `:active` keeps only the mouse.
 *
 * Every constant below was measured against the real Settings and Contacts
 * apps on an iPhone simulator, driven with real HID touches at 60 fps, before
 * it was written down. The machine is deliberately ignorant of the DOM: it
 * takes what happened and answers with what should be painted, so
 * {@link pressGestureStep}'s table of cases IS the state diagram, one arm per
 * requirement.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update pressFeedback.ts (the controller) and
 * pressGesture.test.ts.
