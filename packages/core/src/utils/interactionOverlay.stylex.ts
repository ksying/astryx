/**
 * @file Shared hover and pressed overlay states
 * @input Uses StyleX and the semantic interaction-overlay color tokens
 * @output Exports reusable background-color and background-image state styles,
 *   the touch press's registered strength variable (`pressVars`) and its
 *   clocks (`pressConsts`)
 * @position Internal styling utility for interactive core surfaces
 *
 * Every surface that paints a press composes one of these (or carries its own
 * `:active` rule in the same shape), so a change to how the system answers a
 * press is made here once. `pressedBackgroundColor` is the press without the
 * hover, for controls whose hover is a colour or nothing. `pressedAlpha` is the
 * touch press's strength alone, for an owner whose pressed paint lives on a
 * descendant or a pseudo-element.
 *
 * Keep the enabled guard outside the individual states. StyleX assigns an
 * extra priority bucket (and generated selector specificity) to media-nested
 * rules. Repeating `:active` inside the hover-capable branch gives hover and
 * press the same generated specificity; StyleX's native pseudo-state ordering
 * then emits `:active` last.
 *
 * TWO POINTERS, TWO PRESS MODELS. A mouse keeps `:active`. A finger does not:
 * on iOS Safari `:active` paints on the touch itself and can outlive the start
 * of a scroll, so under `@media (pointer: coarse)` the bare `:active` arm is
 * dropped and the press is written by the touch press controller
 * (`utils/pressFeedback.ts`) as `data-astryx-press="on"` once the press is
 * believed (150 ms, no travel, no scroll) and `data-astryx-press="fading"` for the
 * 200 ms release. The two arms paint those through ONE number:
 *
 *  - `--astryx-press-alpha` is the press's strength, 0 to 1. It is a
 *    registered custom property (`@property`, syntax `<number>`, declared once
 *    in the shipped stylesheet by {@link pressVars}), which is what lets it
 *    animate: the overlay itself is a gradient layer, and gradients do not
 *    interpolate, but a registered number does, and every declaration that
 *    reads it is re-resolved on each frame. The touch paint is the pressed
 *    token at that strength — `color-mix(in srgb, pressed calc(alpha * 100%),
 *    transparent)` — declared once here as `--_press-paint` and painted as a
 *    background IMAGE: an image change is discrete, so a composer's colour
 *    transition cannot fade the onset in.
 *  - `[data-astryx-press="on"]` sets the strength to 1 and paints, on the
 *    first frame. Nothing transitions a custom property a composer never named.
 *  - `[data-astryx-press="fading"]` keeps the same paint and runs the release
 *    animation, strength 1 → 0 over {@link PRESS_RELEASE_DURATION} (UIKit's
 *    deselect crossfade; the controller removes the attribute when the same
 *    clock runs out, and by then the paint is gone). It fades to nothing, not
 *    to the hover strength: under a finger there is no hover to land on.
 *
 * WHY AN ANIMATION AND NOT A TRANSITION. Two reasons, both about composers.
 * StyleX is last-wins per property, and composers own their `transition-*`
 * longhands (Button, Item, Tab, Link, ...): the utility can neither append the
 * strength to their transition list nor set one of its own without taking the
 * whole property from them. No composer sets `animation-*` on the element that
 * composes these, so those longhands are free. And a transition needs the
 * declared value to change at the style change, which would make the release
 * arm declare strength 0; every property reading the strength would then
 * change computed value at the lift, and a composer that transitions
 * `background-image` (Button, Token, TreeListItem — Chromium interpolates
 * same-shape gradients) would start its own, shorter fade over this one. With
 * keyframes owning both ends the release arm declares 1 like the on arm, so at
 * the lift nothing a composer transitions changes; only the animation moves.
 *
 * Browser support: Chromium 111+, Safari 16.4+ and Firefox 128+ register the
 * property and interpolate. An engine without `@property` ignores the rule,
 * animates the unregistered value discretely (the paint holds for half the
 * release, then goes) — a step, no worse than the arm before this one.
 *
 * Composers must not set `backgroundImage` of their own on the colour variants
 * (none do): the touch arms own it. Composers must not set `animation-*` on
 * the element that composes any of these (none do): StyleX would drop either
 * the release animation or theirs.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update pressFeedback.ts, pressGesture.ts (the fade
 * clock), hooks/usePressFeedback.doc.mjs, the components that paint the touch
 * press off an ancestor scope or a pseudo-element (Switch, Tab,
 * CheckboxInput, RadioListItem, ClickableCard, SelectableCard, Thumbnail)
 * and scripts/build-css.test.mjs.
