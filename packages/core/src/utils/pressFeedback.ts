 * @file pressFeedback.ts
 * @input The press state machine (pressGesture.ts) and the document's pointer,
 *   scroll and visibility events
 * @output Exports PRESSABLE_ATTRIBUTE, PRESSED_ATTRIBUTE, pressableProps and
 *   installPressFeedback
 * @position The DOM half of the touch press model: one delegated controller
 *   per document that writes `data-astryx-press` on the nearest pressable surface.
 *   Installed by usePressFeedback (hooks/usePressFeedback.ts) on first mount;
 *   the CSS arms that read the attribute live in interactionOverlay.stylex.ts
 *   and in each component with its own `:active` rule. Tested by
 *   pressFeedback.test.ts.
 *
 * ONE listener set for every pressable surface in the document.
 *
 * Why a delegated document-level controller and not a hook on the element: a
 * virtualized list can carry more than a thousand rows, and four listeners
 * plus a state hook per row is not a cost a list like that can pay. This is
 * six listeners for the whole document, and a press costs one attribute write
 * on one element: no React render, no subscription, no per-element anything.
 * It also makes the behaviour uniform for free: every component that paints a
 * press carries {@link PRESSABLE_ATTRIBUTE}, so all of them change together.
 *
 * Under a mouse the controller does nothing and CSS `:active` keeps the press,
 * as it always has. Under a finger the `:active` arm is dropped by the CSS
 * (`@media (pointer: coarse)`) and this writes `data-astryx-press="on"` when the
 * press is believed and `data-astryx-press="fading"` for the release's exit.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update pressGesture.ts, hooks/usePressFeedback.ts,
 * utils/interactionOverlay.stylex.ts and pressFeedback.test.ts.

 *    `flashEnd`, leaving `data-astryx-press="on"` painted indefinitely. iOS Safari
 *    delivers that cancel at `scrollend`, seconds after the tap, so it is not

 *  - the same inside the 200 ms fade strands `data-astryx-press="fading"` and the
