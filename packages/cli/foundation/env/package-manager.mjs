/**
 * Detect the project's package manager, with the reasoning attached.
 * Walks up from targetDir, taking the first directory that answers.
 *
 * The order within a directory, strongest first:
 *
 * 1. **The declared `packageManager` field.** This is the project saying which
 *    one it uses — corepack's field, the only signal a person writes on
 *    purpose — so it decides, whatever lockfiles happen to sit beside it. A
 *    single `yarn install` in a pnpm project drops a `yarn.lock` that never
 *    goes away, and letting that trace outrank the declaration made every
 *    command the CLI printed wrong for the project, including the invocation
 *    line written into agent docs, which agents copy. The contradicted
 *    lockfiles come back as `strayLockfiles` so `doctor` can say so.
 * 2. **A single lockfile**, when nothing is declared. Unambiguous, and the
 *    long-standing fallback.
 * 3. **A committed package-manager config** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
 *    `.yarnrc.yml`, `bunfig.toml`), when several lockfiles tie and nothing is
 *    declared. A stray `install` drops a lockfile; it does not write one of
 *    these.
 * 4. **Nothing project-owned decides it** — then the answer is not a guess, it
 *    is `'npx'`, which runs correctly under every package manager, plus
 *    `ambiguous: true` so `astryx doctor` can report the real problem. (Same
 *    idea as `findConfigPath`, which refuses to choose between coexisting
 *    configs.)
 * 5. **The runner**, only once the whole walk found nothing on disk.
 *    Deliberately last, and never a tiebreak: an agent handed the wrong `yarn
 *    astryx` line runs the CLI *through yarn*, so the runner agrees with the
 *    mistake and the wrong line reproduces itself forever.
