# @astryxdesign/cli

The CLI is the primary interface for working with the design system, for humans and machines alike. It provides component documentation, design tokens, page templates, theming tools, and upgrade codemods, all accessible via terminal commands, a typed JSON API, or programmatic imports. AI agents and build tools use the same API that powers the CLI, enabling end-to-end frontend development loops.

Run it one-off with the scoped package (works whether or not it's installed):

```bash
npx @astryxdesign/cli --help
npx @astryxdesign/cli search button
npx @astryxdesign/cli component Button
npx @astryxdesign/cli docs tokens
npx @astryxdesign/cli docs migration
npx @astryxdesign/cli template --list
```

Once it's a project dependency (`npm install -D @astryxdesign/cli`), drop the scope and use the shorter `astryx` — e.g. `npx astryx component Button` or `pnpm exec astryx component Button`. Bare `astryx` resolves to an unrelated npm package until the CLI is installed, so prefer the scoped form above for first-run/one-off use.

## Reading the CLI's own docs

The CLI documents itself, so these commands print what the installed version does:

- `astryx <command> --help`: one command's arguments and options.
- `astryx manifest --json`: every command, option, and response type, as JSON.
- `astryx docs cli`: the CLI's docs tree, one level at a time.
  `astryx docs cli/commands` lists every command, `astryx docs cli/api` lists
  the API's functions, schemas, and enums, and a route such as
  `astryx docs cli/api/functions/search` prints one.
- `astryx docs authoring --index`: the authoring reference, with one section for
  each file an author writes: the `astryx.config.*` file, the
  `astryx.integration.*` manifest, codemods, and every doc type (`ComponentDoc`,
  `TemplateDoc`, `ThemeDoc`, and the rest). Read one section with
  `astryx docs authoring <section>`, for example `astryx docs authoring config`.
- `astryx docs cli/integrations`: the guides to building an integration package,
  from a quick start to publishing.
- `astryx docs`: every docs topic, including the design-system guides (for
  example `tokens`, `theme`, and `layout`).

## Finding things: `astryx search`

When you don't know whether what you need is a component, a hook, a docs topic,
or a template, search across all of them at once. Results are ranked by
relevance (name and keyword matches outrank incidental prose mentions, with
fuzzy matching for typos) and tagged with their domain plus the follow-up
command to run:

```bash
$ astryx search button

Results for "button" (20 of 239):

  [component]  Button
               Button triggers an action when clicked. Use it for form submissions…
               → astryx component Button

  [component]  IconButton
               A button that shows only an icon with no visible text…
               → astryx component IconButton

  [hook]       useClickableContainer
               Makes a container element clickable while preserving nested…
               → astryx hook useClickableContainer

  [template]   Banner — Collapsible
               Combine an action button, dismiss control, and expandable detail area…
               → astryx template BannerCollapsibleContent
```

(The CLI prints the follow-up commands with your actual runner — `npx astryx …` when installed, or `npx @astryxdesign/cli …` when run one-off.)

Options:

- `--type <component|hook|doc|template|theme>`: restrict to a single domain (`doc` and `theme` work outside an app too)
- `--limit <n>`: cap the number of results (default 20)
- `--verbose`: also print each result's match score and reason
- `--json`: typed `{ apiVersion, type: 'search', data: { query, matchCount, results } }` envelope — `matchCount` is how many candidates matched in total, `results` the slice `--limit` allowed

### Global options

`--json` works with every command listed in `jsonSupported` (`astryx manifest --json`), which is every command except the bare groups such as `astryx theme`. The other four change only the reads named here; other commands ignore them:

- `--json`: Output as typed JSON envelope: `{ apiVersion, type, package?, data, meta? }` (errors: `{ apiVersion, error, code, suggestions? }`)
- `--detail <level>`: Detail level for `component`, `hook`, and docs tree reads (such as `astryx docs cli/commands/build`), increasing in size: `brief` (names only, default for lists) < `compact` (names + 1-line descriptions) < `full` (full docs per entry). Single-item views default to `full`.
- `--zh`: Simplified Chinese for component reads and for docs topics that have a translation (English otherwise)
- `--dense`: Token-efficient dense text for `astryx component <Name>` and `astryx docs <topic>`
- `--lang <locale>`: Language or format for component and docs reads: `en` (default), `zh` (as `--zh`), or `dense` (as `--dense`)

## JSON API

Every command supports `--json` for machine-readable output. Responses are typed envelopes:

```json
{"apiVersion": 1, "type": "component.detail", "data": {"name": "Button", ...}}
```

Errors:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "error": "No component named \"Buttn\"",
  "code": "ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPONENT",
  "suggestions": [{"name": "Button", "reason": "similar name"}]
}
```

The `code` field is a **stable, machine-readable identifier**. Branch on it,
never on the human-readable `error` string, which changes freely as we improve
wording. Every error envelope carries a `code` (falling back to `ERR_UNKNOWN`
when no more specific code applies). The same `code` is exposed on thrown
`AstryxError` instances from the programmatic API, so both surfaces agree.

Codes are **append-only**: once shipped, a code's meaning never changes and a
code is never removed. New error conditions get new codes.

```typescript
import {isError} from '@astryxdesign/cli/json';

const result = parseResponse(raw);
if (isError(result)) {
  switch (result.code) {
    case 'ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPONENT':
      // suggest the closest match
      break;
    case 'ERR_CORE_NOT_FOUND':
      // prompt the user to install @astryxdesign/core
      break;
    default:
      console.error(result.error);
  }
}
```

| `ERR_UNKNOWN_COMMAND`             | A top-level command name was not recognized (e.g. `astryx bogus`).                                                                                       |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_SUBCOMMAND`          | A subcommand under a command group was not recognized (e.g. `astryx theme bogus`).                                                                       |

| `ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`            | An argument or option value is invalid: wrong type, out of range, an unknown choice, an extra argument, or a conflicting combination.                    |
| `ERR_MISSING_ARGUMENT`            | A required argument or option value was omitted.                                                                                                         |
| `ERR_INVALID_LANG`                | `--lang` was given a value outside its choices (en, zh, dense).                                                                                          |

| `ERR_NODE_VERSION`                | The running Node.js version is below the supported minimum.                                                                                              |
| `ERR_CORE_NOT_FOUND`              | `@astryxdesign/core` could not be located (not installed / not in a monorepo).                                                                           |
| `ERR_CORE_INCOMPATIBLE`           | The installed `@astryxdesign/core` loaded but is too old for this input — it lacks a capability the CLI must call to emit correct output (upgrade core). |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPONENT`           | No component matched the requested name.                                                                                                                 |

## Capability manifest (agent discovery)

Agents don't have to scrape `--help` to learn the CLI. A single call returns a
**self-describing manifest**: every command, its arguments, flags (with types,
choices, and defaults), whether it supports `--json`, the response `type`
discriminators each command can emit, and its documented exit codes. Think of it
as an OpenAPI spec for the CLI.

```bash
astryx manifest --json        # dedicated surface — type: "manifest"
astryx --json                 # bare invocation — embeds the same payload under data.manifest
```

Shape:

```jsonc
{
  "apiVersion": 1,
  "type": "manifest",
  "data": {
    "name": "astryx",
    "version": "0.0.14",
    "description": "Design system CLI — components, themes, and tooling",
    "globalOptions": [
      {

        "type": "enum",
        "choices": ["en", "zh", "dense"],
      },
      {
        "flag": "--detail <level>",
        "type": "enum",
        "choices": ["full", "compact", "brief"],
        "default": "full",
      },
    ],

      {
        "name": "component",
        "description": "List components or print component docs",
        "arguments": [
          {
            "name": "name",
            "required": false,
            "variadic": false,
            "description": "",
          },
        ],
        "options": [
          {
            "flag": "--props",
            "type": "boolean",
            "description": "Print only the props table",
          },
        ],
        "json": true,
        "responseTypes": [
          "component.list",
          "component.detail",
          "component.detail.props",
          "…",
        ],
        "examples": ["astryx component Button --props --json"],
        "exitCodes": [
          {"code": 0, "when": "success"},
          {"code": 1, "when": "…"},
        ],
      },
      // …one entry per command; subcommands (e.g. `theme build`) nest under `subcommands`
    ],
    "jsonSupported": ["component", "docs", "…"],
    "responseTypes": {
      "component": ["component.list", "…"],
      "theme build": ["theme.build"],
    },
  },
}
```

The manifest is **derived from Commander metadata** (commands, arguments, options)
so it can't drift from the real command definitions. The facts Commander doesn't
track come from each command's docs: examples from its CommandDoc, and emitted
response types from the returns of the FunctionDoc it wraps (plus the few
envelopes the CLI layer builds itself). `--json` support comes from the
`JSON_SUPPORTED` allowlist. Drift tests (`manifest.test.mjs`) fail CI when a
command is added without describing it.

**Backwards-compat:** the bare `astryx --json` envelope keeps `type: "help"` and its
original shallow fields (`name`, `version`, `commands` as a `string[]` of names,
`jsonSupported`); the full structured manifest is additive under `data.manifest`.
For the standalone manifest envelope (`type: "manifest"`), use `astryx manifest --json`.

## Programmatic API

The same logic that powers `astryx --json` is available as importable, type-safe functions:

```typescript
import {
  component,
  docs,
  discover,
  template,
  hook,
  search,
  AstryxError,
} from '@astryxdesign/cli/api';

// Same result as: astryx --json component Button
const btn = await component('Button');
btn.type; // 'component.detail'
btn.data.name; // 'Button' (typed as ComponentDoc)

// Same result as: astryx --json component --list
const list = await component(undefined, {list: true});
list.data; // Record<string, string[]>

// Same result as: astryx --json docs principles
const principles = await docs('principles');
principles.data.title; // 'Principles'

// Same result as: astryx --json hook useMediaQuery
const useMediaQuery = await hook('useMediaQuery');
useMediaQuery.data.params; // typed as HookParamDoc[]

// Errors throw AstryxError with a stable .code and optional .suggestions
try {
  await component('Buttn');
} catch (e) {
  e.message; // 'No component named "Buttn"'
  e.code; // 'ERR_UNKNOWN_COMPONENT' (stable; branch on this)
  e.suggestions; // [{ name: 'Button', reason: 'similar name' }]
}
```

The CLI command handlers are thin wrappers around these functions: they parse args, call the API, then format the output (JSON or text). This guarantees that `@astryxdesign/cli/api` and `astryx --json` always return identical data.

### Consumer utilities

If you're spawning the CLI as a subprocess rather than importing the API directly:

```typescript
import {parseResponse, isError} from '@astryxdesign/cli/json';
import type {
  ComponentDetailResponse,
  ComponentListResponse,
  DocsListResponse,
  // ...import the response types for the commands you consume
} from '@astryxdesign/cli/json';

// parseResponse returns the structural { apiVersion, type, data, meta? }
// envelope; `data` is `unknown` until you narrow it. Reconstruct the union you
// care about from the per-command response types, then narrow on `type`:
type MyResponse =
  ComponentDetailResponse | ComponentListResponse | DocsListResponse;

const result = parseResponse(stdout);
if (isError(result)) {
  console.error(result.error);
} else {
  const r = result as MyResponse;
  switch (r.type) {
    case 'component.detail':
      r.data.name; // narrowed to ComponentDoc
      break;
  }
}
```

Prefer narrowing at the call site? Wrap `assertResponse` (which throws on
error/mismatch) with your reconstructed union:

```typescript
import {assertResponse} from '@astryxdesign/cli/json';
import type {ComponentDetailResponse} from '@astryxdesign/cli/json';

type MyResponse = ComponentDetailResponse; /* | ...others */

function assertTyped<T extends MyResponse['type']>(raw: unknown, type: T) {
  return assertResponse(raw, type) as Extract<MyResponse, {type: T}>;
}

const detail = assertTyped(stdout, 'component.detail');
detail.data.name; // narrowed
```

> **Migration (removed in the structural-`jsonOut` release):** the central
> `CLIAnyResponse`, `CLIResponseType`, and `CLIResponseDataMap` exports were
> removed. `parseResponse` / `assertResponse` no longer auto-narrow `.data`.
> Rebuild the union from the individual `*Response` types as shown above — they
> are all still exported from `@astryxdesign/cli/json`.

### Type discriminators

Every response has a `type` discriminant. The full set is below (generated from the manifest). Each command's `type`s are also listed in `astryx manifest --json`, and the matching `*Response` TypeScript types (e.g. `ComponentDetailResponse`) are exported from `@astryxdesign/cli/json`. Errors use `CLIError`, and unsupported commands use `CLIUnsupportedError`.

Every row carries `selector` and `status` (found \| not_found \| ambiguous \| error). A found row carries `result`, the same {type, data} response as one selector. An ambiguous row carries `code`, `error`, and `candidates` ({package, component, kind, installed}). Other failed rows carry `code`, `error`, and optional `suggestions` ({name, reason}).                       |

## Doctor

`astryx doctor` runs read-only health checks against your project and
environment. Each record uses `[ok]`, `[warn]`, `[fail]`, or `[info]`, and
includes an actionable `fix` when one is available. Field names match the
`--json` keys. The exact checks and values depend on the project; the output
shape is stable:

```
$ astryx doctor
astryx doctor - diagnosing your setup

id:      node-version
status:  [ok]
label:   Node.js version
message: Node v24.18.1 meets the minimum (>=22.13.0).

id:      themes
status:  [warn]
label:   Theme packages
message: No @astryxdesign/theme-* packages are installed.
fix:     Install a theme, e.g. `npm install @astryxdesign/theme-neutral`, then import its CSS or set astryx.theme.

...

summary

pass: 4
warn: 2
fail: 0
info: 2

No failures - but review the [warn] warnings above when you can.
```

### Checks

| Check                        | Status it can return | What it verifies                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js version              | pass / fail          | Running Node meets the CLI's minimum                                         |
| @astryxdesign/core installed | pass / fail          | `@astryxdesign/core` is resolvable from the project                          |
| Version alignment            | pass / warn / info   | Installed `@astryxdesign/core` is in step with `@astryxdesign/cli`           |
| Theme packages               | pass / warn          | An `@astryxdesign/theme-*` package is installed and a theme is wired         |
| astryx.config.mjs            | pass / fail / info   | Config (if present) loads cleanly with a valid shape                         |
| AI agent docs                | pass / warn / info   | Agent docs exist and contain the Astryx section markers                      |
| Peer dependencies            | pass / warn / info   | `@astryxdesign/core`'s peer deps (react, …) are installed                    |
| Package manager              | info / warn / fail   | Reports the selected package manager and ambiguous or contradictory evidence |

### CI gate

The exit code is the contract: `astryx doctor` exits `0` when there are no
failures (warnings are fine) and `1` when any check fails. That makes it
usable directly as a CI step:

```yaml
- run: npx @astryxdesign/cli doctor
```

Use `--json` for a structured envelope (`{ apiVersion, type: "doctor",
data: { checks, summary } }`) that AI agents and scripts can parse.

### Integration authoring

`astryx doctor integration` checks one integration package without changing it.
Omit `[package]` to inspect the package at the current directory, or pass an
installed package name:

| Command                                   | What it checks                                               | Exit `1` when                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doctor integration validate [package]`   | Manifest shape and every declared contribution               | A structural issue has error severity                   |
| `doctor integration templates [package]`  | Template IDs shared with Core                                | The integration is invalid; ID conflicts are warnings   |
| `doctor integration components [package]` | Component names shared with Core                             | The integration is invalid; name conflicts are warnings |
| `doctor integration docs [package]`       | Core topic replacements, extensions, and same-name conflicts | A Core overlap is accidental or the docs are invalid    |

Template and component conflicts include the exact `--package` command needed
to select the integration contribution. Doc replacements and extensions are
reported as intentional; a same-name topic without an explicit relationship is
an error. Every leaf supports `--json`.

## Configuration

The CLI reads an optional `astryx.config.{ts,mjs,js}` from your project root
(a sibling of `package.json`). Every field is optional; with no config file the
CLI runs on defaults.

```typescript
export default {
  integrations: ['@acme/astryx-widgets'],
  issuesUrl: 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues',
};
```

There is no factory: write a plain object. For editor autocomplete and
type-checking, annotate it with the `AstryxConfig` type exported from
`@astryxdesign/cli/authoring`.

| Field                         | Type                           | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `integrations`                | `string[]`                     | Integration package names to load (see [Integrations](#integrations)).                          |
| `issuesUrl`                   | `string`                       | Where "report an issue" links point for your project. Defaults to the core issue tracker.       |
| `hooks.postCodemod`           | `PostCodemodHook[]`            | Commands to run after `astryx upgrade` applies codemods (e.g. reinstall, rebuild, reformat).    |
| `experimental.xle.components` | `Record<string, XleComponent>` | Register app-local components so layout (XLE) expressions can reference them by name. Unstable. |

The config is validated against a strict schema when the CLI loads it, so an
unknown field is a hard error rather than a silent no-op. `astryx doctor`
reports whether the config loads cleanly.

## Core codemod authoring

Core codemods live under `packages/cli/assets/codemods/transforms/`. Released
codemods are grouped by the target package version (`v0.3.0`, `v0.3.1`, ...),
which is the version that first contains the breaking change.

Do not guess that version in ordinary feature PRs. Add new codemods to
`packages/cli/assets/codemods/transforms/next/` instead:

- put transform modules and tests in `transforms/next/`;
- maintain `transforms/next/index.mjs` with the run order for the staged
  transforms;
- leave `transforms/next/README.md` in place; it documents the staging area and
  is never promoted.

During the Version Packages PR, `pnpm version-packages` runs
`scripts/promote-codemod-next.mjs` after `changeset version`. The script copies
all staged entries except the README into `transforms/v<new-core-version>/`,
registers that version in `packages/cli/assets/codemods/registry.mjs`, and clears
the promoted files from `next`.

This mirrors Changesets: feature PRs stage migration work without knowing the
future release number; the release PR assigns the exact version.

## Integrations

An **integration** is any npm package that contributes its own components,
templates, and upgrade codemods to Astryx. The CLI surfaces them next to core's,
through the same commands, so a consumer can `astryx component`,
`astryx template`, and `astryx upgrade` across core and every integration
uniformly. Use it to ship a first-party add-on, publish a third-party component
library, or share an internal design-system package across apps.

The system runs on two files, each with a small typed API:

| File                             | Written by | Role                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `astryx.config.{ts,mjs,js}`      | Consumer   | Lists which integration packages to load. |
| `astryx.integration.{ts,mjs,js}` | Author     | Declares what a package contributes.      |

The consumer side is the `integrations` field of [`astryx.config`](#configuration).
The author side is the integration manifest below.

### The integration manifest

A package becomes an integration by exporting a manifest from
`astryx.integration.{ts,mjs,js}` at its root (a sibling of `package.json`). The
manifest points at where each kind of contribution lives; identity (name,
version) comes from `package.json`, not the manifest.

```typescript
export default {
  components: './components',
  templates: './templates',
  codemods: './codemods',
  issuesUrl: 'https://github.com/acme/widgets/issues',
};
```

| Field        | Type     | Purpose                                                                           |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `components` | `string` | Directory holding the package's components and their `.doc.*` files.              |
| `templates`  | `string` | Directory holding the package's page/block templates.                             |
| `codemods`   | `string` | Directory holding upgrade codemods run by `astryx upgrade`.                       |
| `docs`       | `string` | Directory of reference docs; each `{topic}.doc.*` becomes a topic the CLI serves. |
| `issuesUrl`  | `string` | Where "report an issue" links for this package's contributions point.             |

Every field is optional; declare only the roots the package ships. There is no
factory: write a plain object, and annotate it with the `AstryxIntegration` type
from `@astryxdesign/cli/authoring` for editor autocomplete and type-checking.

### How it works

Every command loads the consumer's `astryx.config`, resolves each listed
integration's manifest from `node_modules`, and discovers its contributions.
Everything is parsed at the load boundary, so the CLI presents core and
integration contributions through a single, uniform surface. A field of the
wrong type fails there; a field this CLI does not know is ignored with a
warning naming it, so a manifest written against a newer CLI still contributes
everything this one understands.

Discovery is resilient. A manifest load failure skips that package with a warning.
An invalid contribution kind remains reportable without hiding other valid kinds,
and invalid template or component metadata is omitted without hiding valid siblings.
Warnings go to stderr and never corrupt a `--json` envelope. To inspect problems, run
`astryx doctor integration validate <package>` for structure, then use `templates`,
`components`, or `docs` under the same `astryx doctor integration` group to check
Core identity overlaps before publishing. Bare `astryx doctor` checks overall
project health.
