/**
 * @file The CommandDoc -> Commander converter. One place turns a typed
 * `CommandDoc` (+ the FunctionDoc it wraps, for inherited param descriptions)
 * into a configured Commander command, so `--help` and the manifest can be
 * sourced from the same colocated docs that feed `astryx docs` and the docsite.
 *
 * The CommandDoc type lives in `@astryxdesign/cli/authoring` with no Commander
 * dependency; this converter is the CLI-side adapter. Only the metadata is
 * generic — each command still supplies its own action (the thin wrapper that
 * calls the api function and renders).
 *
 * It is also where a run's RESULT is recorded. Every command that ships passes
 * through here, so an action returns a {@link CommandResult} and this converter
 * stamps it onto the run's debug event — one place, for all of them. That is
 * deliberate: reporting used to be a call each command made on its way out, and
 * a command that forgot simply reported nothing. Now the return type asks the
 * question at authoring time and the converter answers it at runtime, so a new
 * command is logged correctly without doing anything at all.
 *
 * @input a CommandDoc (+ optional FunctionDoc) + an action returning a result
 * @output a configured commander Command added to the given parent
 * @position packages/cli/clients/cli/lib — CLI command converter
