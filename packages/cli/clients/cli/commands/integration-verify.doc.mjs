    'Packs the package with npm, unpacks the tarball into a temporary app without installing its dependencies, and checks that the app sees the same components, templates, themes, docs, and codemods as the package, that every public import resolves, and that the package declares a CLI new enough to read it. It publishes nothing and leaves no tarball behind. It runs the package\'s own pack lifecycle scripts, as `npm pack` does.',
