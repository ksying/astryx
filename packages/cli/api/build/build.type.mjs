The page ranker picks every start: it weighs each matched word by how rare it is among page templates, favors the family the idea's head names and the container it names ("in a modal"), and discounts words that only modify another. `direct` when its pick is also search's direct match (`directMatch`); `closest` when it is not; `fallback` when no template has the evidence to lead and the page starts from the app shell.

 * @property {boolean} data.directMatch True when the top page template is a confident direct match.
 * @property {BuildStart | null} data.start The page template to start from: the ranker's pick, else the app shell. Null only when the kit is narrowed to components or hooks (`type`), or when the project has no page template to offer.
 * @property {import('../search/search.type.mjs').SearchResultEntry[]} data.pages Closest page templates by search (≤3). Each entry's `command` carries `--skeleton` when `directMatch` is false, so it previews the layout; `start.command` is the scaffold.
