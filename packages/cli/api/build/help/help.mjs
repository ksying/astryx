/**
 * @file build.help leaf — the "how to build a page" playbook.
 *
 * `build` with no query returns this envelope. The playbook is data — steps,
 * rules, and related lookups — so a `--json` or programmatic caller gets the
 * same guidance the terminal shows. Commands are bare subcommands with no
 * package-manager prefix, which keeps the JSON environment-agnostic; the CLI
 * renders each one with the caller's invocation, as it does build.kit's
 * `hint.commands`.
 *
 * The workflow starts every page from a template, because a template already
 * has the frame, spacing, and section rhythm that a page composed from
 * components has to rediscover.
 */
