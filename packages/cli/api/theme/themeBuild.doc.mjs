  summary:
    'Compile a defineTheme() file to scoped CSS, a JS module, and type declarations, or check committed outputs for drift in CI.',
  description:
    'The compiler behind `astryx theme build`. Reads a file that calls defineTheme() and ' +
    'writes a scoped CSS file, a JS module that re-exports the built theme, and a .d.ts ' +
    '(plus an optional .variants.d.ts when the theme adds custom prop values). It uses ' +
    "@astryxdesign/core's own generator, so the CSS matches what the <Theme> runtime emits. " +
    'When another build step emits the icon registry, ' +
    '{iconsSpecifier} declares the fully specified module path for the generated JS import. ' +
    'Real registry imports are preserved, including aliases, default imports, and namespace ' +
    'imports. Icons inherited through extends are retained, with child entries taking precedence. ' +
    'Comment and string contents do not affect import detection. ' +
    'An inline registry that cannot be preserved fails with ERR_THEME_INVALID before any ' +
    'output is written, including in check mode. Move the registry to its own module and ' +
    'import it into the theme file. ' +
    'With {check: true} it writes nothing and instead compares ' +
    'each output against disk, returning the drift: the CI guard for committed, generated theme CSS.',
