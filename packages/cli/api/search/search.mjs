/**
 * @file Programmatic API for the unified `search` command.
 *
 * Returns the same typed envelope { type, data } that `xds --json search`
 * outputs. The CLI command handler is a thin wrapper around this function.
 *
 * `search(query)` is the single "I'm looking for X" entry point across ALL
 * content domains — components, hooks, docs topics, templates (page + block),
 * and themes. Finding the right thing otherwise takes separate list calls
 * (`component --list`, `hook --list`, `docs`, `template --list`, `theme list`)
 * plus manual scanning; this collapses them into one ranked, typed result set.
 *
 * Scoring is keyword + fuzzy ranking (NOT semantic / embeddings — that is a
 * deliberate future follow-up). It reuses the same signal weighting as the
 * component fuzzy resolver in lib/string-utils.mjs:
 *
 *   100  exact name match
 *    95  name is the term's plural or stem form ("buttons" -> Button)
 *    90  exact keyword match
 *    88  keyword is the term's plural or stem form
 *    80  name Levenshtein distance 1 (one-word lookups, words of 5+ letters)
 *    70  keyword word prefix / distance 1 (distance: one-word lookups, 5+ letters)
 *    60  name word prefix (>=4 chars, >=50% coverage)
 *    60  exact weak-keyword match
 *    50  description / prose mentions the term
 *    45  usage guidance mentions the term
 *    40  name Levenshtein distance 2 (one-word lookups, 8+ letters)
 *    40  weak-keyword word prefix
 *    30  keyword Levenshtein distance 2 (one-word lookups, 8+ letters)
 *    20  name Levenshtein distance 3 (one-word lookups, 11+ letters)
 *
 * Name + keyword signals always outweigh description/prose, so an exact match
 * sorts above an incidental mention.
 *
 * A term matches inside a name or keyword only at the start of one of its
 * words: "dash" finds "dashboard" and "input" finds "TextInput", but "file"
 * does not find "profile". Edit distance is typo tolerance, so it applies only
 * to a one-word lookup, where a typo is the likely explanation, and only to
 * words long enough that one edit rarely makes another real word. In a
 * sentence, a near miss is usually a different word: "site" is not "side",
 * "cable" is not "table".
 *
 * A multi-word query has a reserved top tier (see {@link scoreQuery}): the
 * whole query as a candidate's name or keyword (190-200), then the whole query
 * as a phrase inside a doc's title or one of its headings (170), then a whole
 * title of two words or more inside the query (160-169), then a candidate that
 * matches every word of the query, at least one of them by name or keyword
 * (151-159). Below those sits everything else: a partial match, or every word
 * matched only in prose or through the components a page renders. A section titled "Light/Dark Mode" answers `dark
 * mode` better than any doc that merely names `mode` in code, however exactly;
 * "Dark mode" answers `how do I add dark mode`; and a guide whose title and
 * description hold both words of `troubleshoot integration` answers it better
 * than a doc named `integration`.
 *
 * Between domains, ranking adds one rule ahead of the score: domain priority
 * (see {@link domainPriority}). A component, hook, template, or theme whose
 * name or keyword a query word hits ranks ahead of every doc the reader did not
 * ask for by name or title, so `font size` finds `Text` before a typography
 * topic that declares the phrase. A doc the query names, or whose title the
 * query holds, keeps its place.
 *
 * Description and guidance are separate tiers on purpose. A component's own
 * one-line description saying "notification" is a claim about what it IS; the
 * same word inside another component's best-practice advice is a passing
 * mention. Scored equally, `Toast` — "a brief, non-blocking notification" —
 * ties with `Card`, `Dialog` and `Item`, which merely mention notifications in
 * their guidance, and ties break alphabetically, so Toast falls off the end of
 * its own best query.
 *
 * `keywords` carry AUTHORED intent — a block's `componentsUsed`, a page's
 * `category` words. `weakKeywords` are DERIVED: the components a page template
 * happens to render, scraped out of its JSX. Derived signal is deliberately
 * capped below the confident-match gate on its own, because breadth is not
 * relevance. At full keyword strength every rendered component is an
 * independent 90-point shot with no penalty for how many a template has, so
 * the broadest pages (a theme showcase rendering one of everything) win
 * queries they have nothing to do with.
