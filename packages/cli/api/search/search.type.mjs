 * A single ranked search result, tagged with its domain.

 * @property {SearchDomain} domain - Which content domain this result came from.
 * @property {string} name - Primary identifier (component/hook name, doc topic or docs-tree route, template dir, theme slug).
 * @property {number} score - Relevance score (higher is better).
 * @property {string} reason - Human-readable reason the candidate matched (e.g. `keyword "button"`).
 * @property {string} description - One-line description, when available.
 * @property {string} command - Follow-up command to act on this result (e.g. `astryx component Button`, or `astryx theme add --import neutral` for a theme).
 * @property {string} [import] - Import path — present for component and hook results.
 * @property {string} [title] - Doc title — present for doc results.
 * @property {string} [section] - Section key — present when a doc result is one section of a topic; `command` reads only that section.
 * @property {string} package - The npm package that owns the result: `@astryxdesign/core` for a Core component, hook, or template, `@astryxdesign/cli` for a doc the CLI ships, or the integration package that contributed it. For a doc section, the package whose file the section came from.
 * @property {string} [parent] - Command that opens the level above a doc result — its topic's section list for a section, the docs-tree namespace it sits in for a tree node — so a reader can see the siblings and open another.
 * @property {string} [displayName] - Friendly display name — present for template and theme results.
 * @property {'page' | 'block'} [kind] - Template kind (`page` | `block`) — present for template results.
