A doc result is the smallest part that answers: one section (with `section`, and a command that reads only it), one docs-tree route, or a topic, whose command lists its sections. `parent` is the command that opens the level above it: the section list of its topic, the namespace a tree node sits in, the Unorganized level for a flat topic, or the topic list for a top-level namespace. Every doc result also carries `package`, the npm package that authored it (for a section, the package its file came from). A theme result is one theme you can import: `name` is its slug, its command is `astryx theme add --import <slug>`, and `package` is the npm package that ships it (`@astryxdesign/cli` for the CLI\'s own themes).',
