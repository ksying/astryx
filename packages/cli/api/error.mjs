/**
 * @file API error class — carries structured error info matching CLIError shape.
 *
 * `AstryxError` is what the API layer throws. Alongside the human-readable
 * message and optional `suggestions`, it carries a stable machine-readable
 * `code` (see ../foundation/response/error-codes.mjs). When the CLI catches an AstryxError and
 * routes it through `cliError`, it propagates `e.code` so the JSON error
 * envelope's `code` field matches the API contract exactly. The code defaults
 * to `ERR_UNKNOWN` so older throw sites still produce a valid envelope.

/**
 * The error for a write that failed on the filesystem: no permission, a
 * read-only mount, a full disk, a path component that is not a directory.
 *
 * A raw Node errno error reached the envelope as
 * `{"error": "EACCES: permission denied, open '/home/you/p/readonly/x.tsx'",
 * "code": "ERR_UNKNOWN"}` — the wrong code (ERR_WRITE_FAILED is in the frozen
 * registry for exactly this) and an absolute host path in the message. This
 * keeps the errno, which is the part that tells you what to fix, and reports
 * the target the way every other Astryx message does: relative to the project.
 *
 * A caller that wrote files before the failure must undo them first and pass
 * the ones it could not restore as `unrestored`, so the message never says
 * nothing was written when something was.
 *
 * @param {string} target absolute path the write was aimed at
 * @param {string} cwd project root, for the relative form
 * @param {unknown} cause the error the filesystem call threw
 * @param {string[]} [unrestored] absolute paths an undo could not put back
