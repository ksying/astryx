[feat] An integration component can replace a Core component, once its package opts in

An `@acme/nav` component whose doc sets `replaces: 'SideNav'` takes over `SideNav` for unqualified component detail, batch selectors, every `component --list` detail level, `search`, `swizzle`, and gap-report routing, when `@acme/nav` declares `"@astryxdesign/cli": ">=0.6.7"` in `peerDependencies` (optional in `peerDependenciesMeta`). Every result names its package, `--package @astryxdesign/core` still selects the original Core component, and the replacement keeps answering to its own name. `component SideNav --package @acme/nav` also selects it.

Any `@astryxdesign/cli` range that starts at 0.6.7 or later is the opt-in, including the `>=0.7.0` that `integration add doc --parent` wrote in 0.6.4 and 0.6.5, and `integration add theme` in 0.6.5. A package whose range admits an earlier CLI keeps its component under its own name and Core stays selected, and an app that loads it sees no new output; its author gets warnings naming the range to add, from `astryx doctor integration components` and `integration verify`. For a package that declares the range, `astryx doctor integration components` reports a missing Core target, an invalid value, a component named after a different Core component, or two replacements for one target in the package as errors and exits 1. When several packages replace one target, an explicitly configured package beats an autolinked one, the later configured package wins, and Doctor warns.
