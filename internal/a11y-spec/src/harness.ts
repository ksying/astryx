 * @output The evidence-layer vocabulary and the Harness/Subject seam every
 *   expectation is written against.
 * @position The runtime seam of @astryxdesign/a11y-spec. One contract, many
 *   harnesses: a harness declares which evidence layers it can observe, and the
 *   runner refuses to run an expectation the harness cannot see.
 *
 * The layers and their boundaries are the ones in the accepted records:
 * `docs/specs/AST-020/spec.md` FR6 lists them; `docs/specs/AST-009/spec.md`
 * bounds what each one proves. The rule that makes them worth having is that a
 * lower layer may not claim a result only a higher layer observes — so jsdom
 * never reports a computed accessible name, and no automated layer ever reports
 * what a screen reader says.
