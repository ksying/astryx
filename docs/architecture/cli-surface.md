# CLI surface architecture

## Purpose

The Astryx CLI is how an agent reaches Astryx. Everything an agent needs while
building with the design system — what exists, what it does, how to use it,
what is wrong with the code in front of it — is reachable through one command
surface, in one predictable shape, with no person in the loop.

The CLI has one audience: an agent running it in a subprocess. A person at a
terminal is a supported reader of the output, never the caller the design
serves. Every rule below follows from that one fact.

This record describes the shipped surface: how a command is invoked, what it
may emit, how it fails, and where its code lives. It does not describe what
the commands do.

## System model

A run has four stages, and each one is a place where the surface is enforced
rather than left to the command author.

1. **Preflight.** `clients/cli/bin/astryx.mjs` gates the Node version using
   only built-ins, before importing anything that could fail on an old
   runtime. The gate honours `--json` with a hand-rolled envelope carrying
   `ERR_NODE_VERSION`.
2. **Dispatch.** `clients/cli/index.mjs` parses with Commander, sets JSON mode
   in `preAction` before any command body runs, and rejects a command that
   cannot support `--json` before any side effect.
3. **Work.** The command parses its arguments and calls a function in `api/`.
   The command is a thin wrapper: parse, call, render. The API function is the
   unit that is scriptable and typed, and it is the source of truth for the
   `type` discriminator on its own envelope. `spec:AST-042` FR1 makes this the
   contract; INV20–INV22 fix where each part lives.
4. **Render.** Exactly one of two paths. In `--json` mode, `jsonOut` writes a
   single envelope. Otherwise the formatters render the same values as text,
   from a closed set of blocks (INV23). Nothing else may write to stdout.

Discovery of components, templates, themes, codemods and docs is not per-command. It
goes through the `Project` seam in `foundation/config`, which resolves the
integrations named in `astryx.config` and then autolinks any DECLARED dependency
that ships a root `astryx.integration.*` manifest — a config entry is how a
project pins an integration, not how the CLI finds one. Each integration is
loaded independently. A manifest load failure withdraws that package. An error
in one contribution kind does not hide other valid kinds, and invalid template
or component files do not hide valid siblings.

AST-017 DEC-4 owns stable response-entry fields and requires their complete type,
test, applicable text, and consumer-documentation projections. A `template.list`
entry can carry optional `replaces`, naming the Core id that a winning
integration template supersedes; the Core entry is omitted from the default list
and remains available through explicit Core package selection.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **INV1 — The CLI never asks a question.** No prompt, no TTY detection, no
  read of stdin for control flow. A non-TTY environment is the only supported
  condition, not a fallback. A command with nothing to do exits with a result,
  never a question.
- **INV2 — Every `--json` emission is one valid envelope.** Success is
  `{apiVersion, type, data}` plus optional `package` (INV28) and `meta`. Failure is
  `{apiVersion, error, code}` plus optional `suggestions`. There is no third
  shape, no partial write, and no raw stack trace: an uncaught throw becomes an
  envelope at the bin error boundary.
- **INV3 — The code is the contract; the prose is not.** `code` is stable and
  append-only. Once shipped, a code's meaning never changes and the code is
  never removed. The `error` string may be reworded at any time. A consumer
  branches on `code`.
- **INV4 — Human output is a projection of the JSON, produced only by the
  formatters.** `emit` accepts a renderer-produced `Block` and nothing else, so
  a stray string cannot reach stdout. Output is plain ASCII: no colour, no TTY
  detection, no width wrapping, byte-for-byte identical printed or piped.
- **INV5 — Text field names mirror JSON keys one to one.** The two views cannot
  drift, and every field stays greppable.
- **INV6 — One command, one file.** A command is
  `clients/cli/commands/<name>.mjs`, or `clients/cli/commands/<name>/index.mjs`
  when it is a group, with a sibling `<name>.doc.mjs`. A subcommand's doc is
  `<parent>-<child>.doc.mjs`.
- **INV7 — Every command ships a `CommandDoc`, and the generated surfaces come
  from it.** Help text, the README command and error-code tables, and the
  manifest are generated. None of them is written by hand.
- **INV8 — Exit codes do not depend on the output mode.** The same condition
  exits the same way with and without `--json`, so a command works as a gate
  without parsing stdout.
- **INV9 — A command that cannot support `--json` is rejected before any side
  effect**, not part-way through the work.
- **INV10 — Every write is confined.** Output paths pass `assertWithin`, which
  canonicalises symlinks and rejects a NUL byte; an escape is
  `ERR_PATH_TRAVERSAL`. Bounded inputs are capped rather than trusted.
- **INV11 — A broken integration degrades, it does not fail the run.** The
  `Project` seam loads each integration independently and records the failure.
- **INV12 — Human chatter never touches stdout in JSON mode.** `humanLog` and
  `humanWarn` are the only chatter primitives, and both are no-ops under
  `--json`.
- **INV13 — Agent docs have one rendered source of truth.** Init and upgrade
  render configured integration `agentDocs` through the existing `Project`
  seam. Upgrade compares complete block bytes even when Core is unchanged and,
  when codemods or hooks run, writes the prepared block only after they succeed.
- **INV14 — An installed integration is discoverable without configuration, and
  autolinking it can only add.** A dependency the project DECLARES in
  package.json, and that ships a root `astryx.integration.*` manifest, is
  loaded; `node_modules` is never walked, so nothing the project did not declare
  can contribute. Only the dependency KEY is read, never its value, so an npm
  alias or a non-semver protocol resolves like any other. A config entry keeps
  precedence over the same package autolinked, and a dependency whose manifest
  fails to load is dropped rather than raised as the consuming project's issue.
- **INV15 — Integration authoring writes one complete, discoverable contribution.**
  `integration add <kind> <name>` and its typed per-kind APIs share one receipt
  contract. A dry run reports the same planned paths without writing. A real run
  refuses to clobber authored files, stages related writes atomically, declares
  a contribution root only with valid bytes behind it, and verifies visibility
  through the same discovery seam consumers use.
- **INV16 — Authoring preserves package policy and local source wins while it is
  being edited.** Writers never create `files` or `exports`; when either field
  already exists, they add only the required manifest, root, or public subpath
  and preserve every author-owned entry. Generated component and template export
  keys are extensionless public subpaths even when they target authored `.ts` or
  `.tsx` source. The integration beside the current package.json replaces the
  same installed package in place, preserving its configured order while making
  working bytes authoritative.
- **INV17 — Pack verification examines the artifact consumers receive.**
  `integration verify` runs the package lifecycle through `npm pack`,
  compares the required file inventory with the actual tarball, extracts that
  tarball into a scratch consumer, and reruns contribution discovery. It rejects
  advertised component imports ending in `.ts` or `.tsx`, resolves every exact
  advertised component and inferred template import through Node's package
  resolver, and fails when the packed artifact has no usable public export. This
  contract does not require project-local TypeScript or promise validation under
  TypeScript's Node16 or bundler resolution modes.
- **INV18 — Integration diagnostics are read-only and contribution-specific.**
  Doctor reports malformed or unreachable roots and contribution conflicts
  without rewriting the package. A manifest load failure withdraws the package.
  A contribution-kind error remains visible without hiding other valid kinds.
  Invalid template and component files do not hide valid siblings. A
  package-scoped theme lookup still surfaces that package's blocking catalog
  error instead of misreporting the theme as unknown.
- **INV19 — Integration themes are importable packages; editable source is an
  explicit eject.** The manifest's `themes` root contains one directory per slug.
  Every theme source has a mandatory same-stem, strongly typed `ThemeDoc`; there
  is no root item catalog. Discovery derives the source entry and required named
  export from the shared stem, parses source without executing it, and rejects
  escaped local imports and missing or type-only exports. The theme directory is
  the recursive copy and pack boundary; dot entries and files npm never publishes
  belong to no theme. A dot-folder, or a folder holding neither a descriptor nor
  a `<name>Theme` source, is not a theme and is neither read nor packed, and doctor
  warns about one that looks like a theme; a folder with a theme source and no
  descriptor fails. The one exception is the project's local `src/themes` root:
  a source copy made by the released `theme add` without its descriptor is
  reported as unmigrated, skipped without failing theme commands, and remains
  unmanaged until upgrade adds its missing descriptor. `integration add theme`
  creates public built-module and stylesheet exports and keeps CSS side effectful.
  A package may also export a font stylesheet. `integration verify` rebuilds
  source, compares the local built module and stylesheet, and proves every
  declared theme export resolves from the packed package. `theme list` retains
  package ownership, and `theme add --import` records that owner and imports only built
  outputs. The deprecated plain `theme add` keeps copying source until its scheduled
  cleanup. `theme eject` is the explicit source fork; it copies the complete
  theme directory and same-stem descriptor, with the local descriptor marked as
  not maintained by the package owner.
- **INV20 — A command's API subject has one layout.** A command's behavior lives
  in `api/<subject>/`. `<subject>.mjs` is the subject's entry, and `api/index.mjs`
  re-exports what it exports. A subject with more than one operation puts each in
  a leaf, `<leaf>/<leaf>.mjs`, and the entry dispatches to the leaves. Every
  exported function has a colocated `FunctionDoc` — `<subject>.doc.mjs` for the
  entry function, `<function>.doc.mjs` for any other — and response typedefs in a
  `*.type.mjs` file. Tests sit beside the module they cover as
  `<module>.test.mjs`. A private helper is an underscore-prefixed file, such as
  `_site.mjs`. `api/blog` is the reference layout.
- **INV21 — An API subject reaches the environment only through its adapter.**
  Within `api/<subject>/`, reading or writing files, network requests,
  subprocesses, loading the project or its modules, and discovery that reads the
  disk happen in the subject's adapter: `_adapter.mjs` and any underscore-prefixed
  helper that only it imports. The adapter may call foundation seams such as the
  `Project` seam and `assertWithin`. The entry and the leaves shape inputs and
  results and call the adapter; they do not import filesystem, network, or
  subprocess modules, the `Project` seam, or discovery and loader functions. A
  subject that needs no environment access has no adapter.
  `api/blog/_adapter.mjs` is the reference adapter.
- **INV22 — A command handler parses, calls, and renders.** A handler in
  `clients/cli/commands/` registers through `defineCommand` with its
  `CommandDoc`, and an executable command's `CommandDoc` names in `fn` the API
  function it calls. The handler parses its arguments, calls that function, and
  renders the result through `jsonOut` or the formatter kit. It reads no files,
  loads no project, runs no discovery, and starts no subprocess or network
  request; it may phrase hints with how the CLI was invoked, such as the package
  manager's run prefix. Only command handlers, their `CommandDoc` files, and
  their tests live in that directory. `clients/cli/commands/blog.mjs` is the
  reference handler.
- **INV23 — The formatter kit is closed.** Text output is built only from the
  block constructors in `clients/cli/formatters/index.mjs` — `section`, `text`,
  `list`, `record`, `records`, and `code` — and printed through `emit`. A handler
  does not pad strings to a width, align columns, or draw tables, and it defines
  no renderer of its own; it maps its data onto records, lists, and sections. A
  block kind is added to the kit, with its tests and its line in the help
  "Output format" list, only as `spec:AST-042` FR3 allows.
- **INV24 — Every discoverable integration item owns one typed descriptor.** New
  authoring emits `<source-stem>.doc.mjs`, annotated with its public type from
  `@astryxdesign/cli/authoring`, beside the source or payload it describes. The
  descriptor is the sole per-item metadata authority; `astryx.integration.*`
  locates roots and integration-level capabilities but never catalogs items:
  there is no catalog file under a root and no per-item map or list in the
  manifest (`spec:AST-039/FR11`). A released alternate reader is an isolated
  compatibility path, not a second authoring convention.
- **INV25 — Every CLI doc names the group that reads it.** Each command, API
  function, schema, and enum doc the CLI ships declares a `namespace`. The docs
  tree adopts `cli/commands` and `cli/api` docs, one route each under
  `cli/commands` and `cli/api/<kind>s`; `authoring` docs are sections of
  `astryx docs authoring` and appear in its list. `astryx doctor` fails when a
  CLI doc has no namespace, names one nothing reads, or disagrees with the
  authoring list, so every doc the CLI ships stays readable from the CLI.
- **INV26 — The docs tree gives each doc one home (`spec:AST-046`).** The tree
  is compiled in `foundation/doc-compiler/tree.mjs` from namespace docs, the
  guides they place, and the typed docs they adopt; the CLI's own tree files
  live in `assets/docs/tree/`. A namespace never lists or scans its children.
  `astryx docs <route>` reads it one level at a time, and `astryx doctor` warns
  on any tree error diagnostic or unplaced CLI doc.
  An integration's namespace docs and placed guides join the same tree, named
  by its provider id; the CLI's own docs keep a contested route.
  Every flat topic sits in the generated Unorganized level under its own name,
  so every doc has a home in the tree.
- **INV27 — Every read says where to go next (`spec:AST-047`).** A read names
  its place and ends with its moves (up, down, across, and out) as runnable
  commands, and its JSON carries the same moves as `links`; a search hit
  carries `parent`. Nothing a read shows can go stale: moves are derived, and a
  test proves every command a doc shows is real. `astryx docs` and
  `astryx search` meet it first.
  A link between docs names its target by doc identity and is resolved on
  every read; Doctor warns on one that names no doc.
- **INV28 — Every result names the package each artifact comes from.** A
  `--json` result about one artifact (a component, doc, template, or hook)
  carries `package` in its envelope, directly after `type`. A result
  that lists artifacts gives each listed artifact its own `package`, and a
  doc's sections each name the package that wrote them. Core's components,
  hooks, templates, and codemods name `@astryxdesign/core`; the docs the CLI
  ships name `@astryxdesign/cli`; an integration's artifacts name the
  integration's package, with nothing written for it by the integration's
  author. Two lists of plain names, `hook --list` and `swizzle --list`, hold
  only Core's artifacts and name `package` once, in the envelope; `build`'s
  `frame` and `foundation` are fixed lists of Core component names. Text
  output names the same package. Verbatim source output (`--source`,
  `--showcase`, and a template's source) keeps stdout to the source alone, so
  it pipes byte for byte, and names the package on stderr.

Some modules predate INV20–INV23 and do not meet them yet; `spec:AST-042` lists
the known gaps.

## Change coupling

A change to any of the following requires this record to be re-read, and
updated in the same pull request when it moves an invariant:

- adding, removing, or renaming a command or subcommand;
- adding an error code, or changing what an existing code means;
- a change to a stable JSON envelope or discriminated response-entry field
  follows `spec:AST-017/DEC-4`;
- adding a formatter or block kind (INV23, `spec:AST-042` FR3), or writing to
  stdout from anywhere other than `emit` and `jsonOut`;
- changing the file layout under `clients/cli/commands`;
- adding an API subject, leaf, adapter, or exported function, or giving an API
  module access to the environment (INV20–INV21);
- adding a command, API function, schema, or enum doc, or a namespace a CLI
  doc may declare (INV25);
- adding a docs-tree namespace or guide, or changing how a doc gets its home or
  its route (INV26);
- adding a read that offers no moves, or changing how a move is spelled in text
  or JSON (INV27);
- changing an integration writer's receipt, no-clobber/rollback behavior,
  package.json mutation policy, or public subpath spelling;
- changing what `integration verify` executes, resolves, or proves about
  the tarball;
- changing local, configured, or autolinked integration precedence;
- changing an integration item descriptor, the theme directory boundary, or the consumer copy contract.

`pnpm check:cli-structure` enforces the layout. The contract tests listed in
`verified_by` enforce the envelope, the exit codes, the error codes, and the
non-interactive guarantee.

## Owning code

- `clients/cli/bin/astryx.mjs` — Node floor gate and the error boundary that
  converts an uncaught throw into an envelope.
- `clients/cli/index.mjs` — Commander wiring, JSON-mode gate, dispatch.
- `clients/cli/commands/<name>.mjs` — one command: parse, call the API, render.
- `clients/cli/commands/<name>.doc.mjs` — the `CommandDoc` that generates help
  and the published tables.
- `clients/cli/formatters/index.mjs` — `Block`, `emit`, `section`, `text`,
  `list`, `record`, `records`, `code`, and the shared ASCII vocabulary.
- `foundation/response/json.mjs` — `API_VERSION`, `jsonOut`, `jsonError`,
  `toErrorEnvelope`, `humanLog`, `humanWarn`, the JSON-mode flag.
- `foundation/response/error-codes.mjs` — the frozen, append-only code set.
- `foundation/config` — the `Project` discovery seam and integration precedence.
- `foundation/integrations/manifest-writer.mjs` — safe manifest-root patching,
  verification, and rollback.
- `foundation/integrations/contribution-inventory.mjs` — the shared local and
  packed contribution identity/file contract.
- `api/integration` — contribution writers, diagnostics, and packed-artifact
  verification.
- `foundation/discovery/theme-discovery.mjs` and `api/theme` — typed integration
  theme descriptor discovery, package-aware selection, source copy, and build.
- `foundation/agent-docs` — the shared expected-block renderer and managed-file
  writer used by init and upgrade.
- `api/index.mjs` — the public programmatic API, `@astryxdesign/cli/api`, which
  re-exports every subject's functions.
- `api/<subject>/…` — the scriptable functions the commands wrap, laid out as
  INV20 describes; each owns the `type` on its own envelope.
- `api/<subject>/_adapter.mjs` — the subject's only access to the environment
  (INV21).

## Deciding specs

- `spec:AST-017/DEC-4` — stable response fields and their complete projections
  are current compatibility authority.
- `spec:AST-042/DEC-1` — every command is a thin layer over one programmatic
  function.
- `spec:AST-042/DEC-2` — every command's text output uses one shared block
  vocabulary.
