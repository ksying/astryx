# Overlay dismissal family contract

<!-- review-applicability:v1 -->

```json
{
  "scope": "global",
  "triggers": {
    "layering": ["FR1", "FR2", "FR3", "FR6"]
  }
}
```

## Intent

A person dismissing layered UI should affect only the topmost relevant surface.
A nested surface must not close its host on the same Escape press or platform
close request when logical depth or DOM containment establishes that ordering.

## Membership rule

A component belongs when it owns a layered surface for which Escape or a platform
close request is a valid dismissal command. Every member must participate in the
shared dismissal stack while that surface is present. Membership follows the
observable responsibility, not whether the current implementation has completed
adoption; a local Escape listener is a deviation to migrate, not an intentional
exclusion.

A component that creates its own popup with `usePopover`, `useLayer`, a focus
trap, or a native dialog is a member when it owns that popup's dismissal. A
component that merely composes another member as ancillary content inherits that
member's behavior without joining on that basis. Membership is open-ended:
every newly shipped surface that meets this rule must join the shared stack and
this record's current membership snapshot must be updated with it.

- **Current members:** Dialog, AlertDialog, Popover, DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuSubMenu, MoreMenu, Tooltip, HoverCard, Lightbox, MobileNav,
  BottomSheet, BottomSheetSwitcher, CommandPalette, ContextMenu,
  PowerSearchEditPopover, Lab Drawer, and the component-owned popup surfaces
  listed below.
- **Component-owned input popups:** ChatComposerInput, ComplexSelector,
  DateInput, DateRangeInput, DateTimeInput, Selector, MultiSelector,
  PowerSearch, BaseTypeahead, Typeahead, and Tokenizer. TextInput, TextArea,
  NumberInput, TimeInput, and FileInput do not own a popup; rendering a Tooltip
  for supporting or disabled text does not make the input itself a member.
- **Other component-owned popups:** BreadcrumbItem, SideNavHeading,
  SideNavItem, TabMenu, TopNavHeading, TopNavMenu, TopNavMegaMenu, Table filtering,
  Lab TourStep, and Lab ChatEmojiPicker.
- **Collaborators:** `useLayerDismissal`, `layerStack`, `LayerDepthProvider`,
  and `useFocusTrap` own or adapt the shared protocol.
- **Nonparticipating layers:** A layer that has no dismissal behavior is not a
  member. A visual-only outline rendered through Layer is the canonical example:
  it neither handles Escape nor receives a platform close request.

## Shared owner

- `useLayerDismissal` registers an active surface and adapts a
  browser-initiated close request to the shared topmost check.
- `layerStack` owns presence filtering, ordering, and the single
  document-level Escape listener.
- `LayerDepthProvider` carries logical nesting through the React tree for members
  that provide it to their descendants. Members without that provider do not
  guarantee nested ordering after descendant content leaves DOM containment.
- `useFocusTrap` joins the same stack when it is active and receives an
  `onEscape` callback. A focus trap without `onEscape` is not a dismissible
  surface and does not register.

## Canonical concepts

| Concept         | Values or states           | Default semantics                                                                 | Stability |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| membership      | member or nonparticipant   | A surface with Escape/platform-close behavior is a member                         | current   |
| adoption        | shared, partial, or local  | Local handling is a deviation to migrate, not a membership exception              | current   |
| registration    | active or inactive         | Only an active, enabled surface participates                                      | current   |
| presence        | present or absent          | An absent registered surface is skipped                                           | current   |
| Escape behavior | `close` or `block`         | `close` invokes the member's dismissal callback; `block` consumes without closing | current   |
| logical depth   | non-negative nesting level | A provider marks descendant surfaces as deeper than its host                      | current   |
| close request   | Escape or platform request | The topmost registered present member decides the result                          | current   |

## Cross-component invariants

- **FR1 — Every dismissible layered surface participates.** A member must join
  the shared dismissal stack while present. A component-specific Escape
  listener or registry does not satisfy this invariant.
- **FR2 — One request affects one surface.** An unclaimed Escape press is routed
  to exactly one topmost registered present member. That member either invokes
  its dismissal callback or blocks the request; the request does not continue
  to a member behind it.
- **FR3 — Platform close requests use the same topmost rule.** A member receiving
  a browser or platform close request closes only when it is the topmost
  registered present member. A request aimed at a lower member is declined.
- **FR4 — Available nesting signals outrank host placement.** When a member
  provides `LayerDepthProvider`, React-tree depth orders its descendant layers
  ahead of the member even when both mount in the same commit. DOM containment
  may resolve equal-depth nesting; stable active-cycle registration order resolves
  unrelated surfaces. A member without the provider does not guarantee this
  ordering for descendant content that is no longer DOM-contained.
- **FR5 — Content may claim Escape first.** The shared listener runs in the
  bubble phase and stands down when content has already handled the event.
- **FR6 — Text composition is not layer dismissal.** Escape used to cancel an
  active IME composition is consumed without dismissing a member, and a
  platform close request is declined while composition is active.
- **FR7 — Registration does not define open-state ownership.** The stack invokes
  the selected member's dismissal callback. Whether that request immediately
  closes the surface is owned by the member's component contract and caller.

## Allowed component variation

- **AV1 — Focus.** Members own focus entry, containment, movement, and return.
- **AV2 — Modality.** Members may be modal or non-modal and own any inertness or
  backdrop behavior.
- **AV3 — Positioning and hosting.** Members may use native dialog placement,
  CSS anchor positioning, fixed coordinates, or a component-owned host.
- **AV4 — Outside dismissal.** Members own whether and how pointer, hover,
  focus-loss, backdrop, touch, or gesture interaction dismisses them.
- **AV5 — Open-state API.** Members own controlled and uncontrolled state,
  defaults, callback names, and imperative commands.
- **AV6 — Presentation.** Members own animation, visual treatment, and theming
  anatomy. The dismissal registry exposes no theme target or rendered wrapper.

| Popover inside Dialog                         | Popover handles the first Escape               | Popover supplies anchoring, portal placement, and focus policy                |
| Tooltip or HoverCard inside Dialog            | Present hover surface handles the first Escape | Hover families decide when they are present and how controlled state responds |
| Lightbox or MobileNav above a required Dialog | Top member handles the request                 | Required Dialog uses `block` only when it is topmost                          |
| Required Dialog alone                         | Request is consumed without closing            | Dialog purpose selects `block` behavior                                       |
| Self-owned input popup                        | Popup participates while present               | Input owns selection, focus, open state, positioning, and outside dismissal   |
| Two unrelated registered surfaces             | Later active-cycle registration is topmost     | Neither surface is treated as nested                                          |
| Platform close request sent to a lower Dialog | Lower Dialog stays open                        | The platform targets a host; the shared check decides whether it may close    |

The rows marked partial or local are current adoption gaps against FR1. They are
not approved exceptions. Migration must preserve each component's existing focus,
modality, positioning, outside-dismissal, and open-state contracts.

## Decision links

### DEC-1 — Membership follows dismissal responsibility

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-08-30`

Every layered surface for which Escape or a platform close request is a valid
dismissal command belongs to this family and must participate in the shared
stack. Membership is open-ended: every newly shipped surface that meets this
rule must join the stack. Existing component-local listeners and registries are
adoption gaps, not intentional exclusions. Components that own their own input
popup are members; components that only compose another member as ancillary
content are not members on that basis. The members metadata and adoption table
are the audited current snapshot, not a closed set.

A layer with no dismissal behavior does not participate. A visual-only outline
rendered through Layer is the canonical nonparticipating example.

## Open questions

None. Focus, modality, positioning, outside dismissal, and open-state APIs are
explicitly outside this family contract. The mapped tests do not render a nested
layer through a real portal; a real portal fixture is required before this
contract can claim verified portal coverage.

## Content boundary

This file owns family membership, topmost registered Escape and platform-close
behavior, and the logical-depth and DOM-containment signals currently used to
order those requests. A member guarantees descendant depth only when it provides
`LayerDepthProvider`; this record does not claim verified nesting through a real
portal. It does not define focus entry or return, modality, positioning or
anchoring, portal placement, outside interaction, programmatic component
commands, open-state APIs, animation, or theming. Those remain component,
family, or architecture responsibilities.
