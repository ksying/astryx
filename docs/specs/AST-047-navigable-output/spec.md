# Navigable CLI output system spec

## Intent

Every read the CLI prints is a node in a graph. A reader who lands anywhere,
from a search hit, a link, or a guess, must see where they are and every move
they can make next, as commands they can run: up to the level the node sits
in, down to its children, across to its neighbors, and out to the nodes it
names. Nobody has to know a route in advance or read a long page to find one
fact: they search, land on the smallest node that answers, and move from there.

This record owns the moves a read offers and how they appear in text and JSON.
`spec:AST-046` owns the docs tree those moves walk first.

## Non-goals

- What the nodes of each command are. The docs tree is `spec:AST-046`'s; each
  command that adopts this record decides its own nodes.
- Interactive navigation. There are no prompts, pagers, or state kept between
  runs; each move is its own command.
- Links out of the CLI, such as docsite URLs.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — A read names where it is.** A read below the top MUST name its
  place: a docs-tree node its breadcrumb, a section its topic, and a search hit
  the path of titles above it (`Astryx CLI › API › Functions › search()`).
- **FR2 — Up.** Every read except the top MUST offer the command that opens the
  level it sits in: for a section, its topic's section list; for a node or a
  topic, the level it sits in (a guide's namespace, or the Unorganized level for
  a flat topic, `spec:AST-046` FR12); for a top-level namespace, the topic list.
- **FR3 — Down.** A read that has children MUST list them, each with its
  summary, and give the command that opens one: a namespace its children, a
  topic's index its sections, and the topic list its topics and namespaces. In text,
  a topic with more than one section is read one level at a time: a bare read
  lists its sections, and `--full` prints the whole doc; the dense variant is
  written to be read whole, so `--dense` prints it whole. The JSON contract is
  unchanged: `docs(topic)` and `--json` return the whole doc, and `--index` its
  sections.
- **FR4 — Across.** A read with a place in an ordered level MUST offer the
  commands that open the item before it and the item after it, when they exist:
  a section's neighbors in its topic, and a docs-tree node's neighbors in its
  parent's slot.
- **FR5 — Out.** A read that names another node MUST give the command that
  opens it: a command doc its API function, a function doc its command, and a
  typed doc each doc it lists as related.
- **FR6 — Search lands on nodes.** Each search hit MUST be one node, the
  smallest that answers (`spec:AST-046` FR10), with the command that reads it
  and the command that opens the level above it.
- **FR7 — Moves are commands, and JSON carries them.** In text, each move MUST
  be a whole command with the project's run prefix. In JSON, a read MUST carry
  its moves as data: `links`, with `up`, `previous` and `next` where FR4 applies, and
  `related` where FR5 applies to a typed doc, each an `astryx ...` command; a search hit carries `command` and
  `parent`. `links` MUST be present on every read but the topic list, as a field
  added to each existing response, and the published types MUST type each move
  as an `astryx docs` command. The text view
  MUST stay a projection of the JSON.
- **FR8 — A wrong move says where to go.** A route, topic, or section that does
  not exist MUST fail with a stable error code and suggest the nodes a reader
  can reach from the nearest level that does exist (`spec:AST-046` FR6).
- **FR9 — Moves are derived, not written.** The CLI MUST derive Up, Down, and
  Across from the docs tree and a topic's sections, and Out from a typed doc's
  own fields, so no doc lists its own moves and every provider's docs, from
  Core, the CLI, or an integration, get the same moves. A link from one doc to
  another MUST name its target by doc identity, never by route or title. A bare
  name in a typed field (`fn`, `command`, `related`) names a doc of its own
  provider, so it is a doc identity: it resolves among the kinds its field
  allows, and a name that matches docs of more than one allowed kind is an
  error, never a silent pick. Inside a doc's text, a link MUST be written
  `{@link <target>}` and read as the command that opens its doc; a link that
  names no doc MUST print as written. A topic's section MAY hold a `reference`
  block, which includes the doc it names instead of a copy: a read MUST inline
  it as that doc's content (a schema's content narrowed to the fields its
  projection names), then a line naming that doc and the command that opens
  it, so a read still returns only the stable content blocks. A target, field,
  or projection the block cannot include MUST fail the authoring check.
  `workflow` and `collection` blocks (GraphContentBlock) belong to a namespace
  doc's `blocks`, which a later phase renders. A target without a
  provider names a doc of the provider that wrote the link: in a topic that
  merges sections from several providers, each section resolves against its
  own. The CLI MUST resolve
  every link when it reads a doc, and Doctor MUST warn on a link that is
  unresolved or ambiguous. A link names a doc identity, not a provider instance,
  so it survives version changes.
- **FR10 — Phase 1 covers docs and search.** `astryx docs` and `astryx search`
  MUST meet FR1–FR9, FR11, and FR12. A command a doc shows as an example, in a code
  block or in prose, is not a link: FR11 keeps it true. Other commands adopt
  this record in later phases, each as its own change.
- **FR11 — Nothing a read shows can go stale.** A move or a cross-link MUST be
  derived when the read is made, never stored in a doc. Every other `astryx`
  command that a doc, a hint line, or the repository's agent prompt shows MUST
  name a real command and only options that command takes, and every
  `astryx docs` command it shows MUST open; a test MUST fail the build
  otherwise. A command a doc shows wrong on purpose, as an error-code example,
  MUST be listed as such, and the list MUST fail when an entry is no longer
  shown.
- **FR12 — Every doc is one walk away.** Every doc a provider ships MUST be
  reachable from `astryx docs` by following the moves reads offer: Down from the
  topic list and each namespace, then Across and Out. Neighbors MUST agree: the
  read an item's Next opens names that item as its Previous. A test MUST walk
  the whole graph from the top and fail on a doc file it cannot reach, a move
  that does not open, or a link that names no doc.

### Platform support

The moves are plain commands with the prefix of the project's package manager,
so they run in any shell the CLI runs in. JSON carries them without the prefix.

## Current-state impact

Before this record, only docs-tree namespaces and typed docs offered a way up,
and only in text; a section, a topic, and a topic's index were dead ends.

Phase 1 changes:

- in text, a bare topic read lists the topic's sections when it has more than
  one; `--full` and `--dense` print it whole; `docs(topic)` and `--json` still
  return the whole doc;
- `docs.node`, `docs.index`, `docs.detail`, and `docs.detail.section` carry
  `links`: `up` on every read, and `previous` and `next` on sections and
  docs-tree nodes;
- a section read, a whole-topic read, and a topic's index end with their moves;
- a docs search hit carries `parent` and the path of titles above it;
- links between docs are typed (`{@link <target>}` in text, and the typed
  fields), resolved on every read, and checked by Doctor, which warns; the
  hand-written `astryx docs` links in the CLI's own docs become typed links;
- a test proves every command a doc or hint shows is a real command with real
  options, and every docs command opens;
- a test walks the whole graph from the top and reaches every doc file the CLI
  ships, as FR12 states.

`architecture:cli-surface` INV27 carries this record into the code.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — A move is a command, not a route

**Reference:** `spec:AST-047/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-28`

Each move is a whole `astryx ...` command that a reader can run as is.

Rejected: bare routes. They make the reader rebuild the command and know which
argument a section key goes in.

### DEC-2 — Across names the neighbors, not the whole level

**Reference:** `spec:AST-047/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-28`

FR4 names the item before and the item after; the whole level is one move up.

Rejected: listing every sibling on every read, which makes each leaf as long as
its parent.

### DEC-3 — Adopt per command, docs and search first

**Reference:** `spec:AST-047/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-28`

Readers get lost in the docs first, and search is how they arrive. Other
commands adopt the moves as their own changes.

Rejected: one change for every command, which is too large to review and
decides every command's nodes at once.

## Open questions

- Which command adopts this record next, and what its nodes are.
- Whether top-level namespaces offer `previous` and `next` among each other.
