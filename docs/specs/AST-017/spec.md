## Intent

Give contributors, reviewers, and release owners one durable contract for evolving
published Astryx surfaces. Classify every change from the installed consumer it
affects, isolate experimentation from stable behavior, stage deprecations and
behavior corrections explicitly, and make a planned minor traceable to one locked
final-patch baseline.

A valid consumer of the latest stable release is the compatibility test. The label is
not a risk or severity score: a small rename can be incompatible, while a large
rewrite can remain compatible when released usage is preserved. A real bug can also
be incompatible when consumers validly rely on its released behavior; that case uses
the distinct corrective path in FR32–FR35. Its primary Changeset tag remains `[fix]`,
while additive metadata distinguishes it from an ordinary patch-compatible fix and
from a generic `[breaking]` removal.

For CLI controls, keep every supported behavior discoverable and put each control on
the narrowest surface that owns it. Global controls require evidence that their value
and meaning are global. Cross-cutting guarantees must be complete, observable, and
independent for each invocation.

Admission is part of that contract. Main is heading for a patch unless an owner has
scheduled a minor, and incompatible work waits for that schedule. A release does not
change shape because one removal merged ahead of the decision to allow it.

## Non-goals

- Freezing implementation details or every byte of generated example code.
- Defining component or template naming conventions.
- Treating private packages, canaries, unreleased work, or explicitly marked
  experimental surfaces as stable public API.
- Replacing the public Release Process, Changesets, migration tooling, or direct
  component and feature authorities. This spec owns the lifecycle and evidence those
  mechanisms implement; it does not duplicate their operational or product rules.

## Requirements

- **FR1 — Breaking changes need a released victim.** A change is breaking only
  when a valid consumer scenario supported by the latest stable release of a
  published package no longer works unchanged, or produces an incompatible
  result under a documented stable contract. The review names that scenario and
  the released surface it uses.
- **FR2 — Classify against the latest stable release.** A surface added and then
  renamed, removed, or reworked before any stable release has no installed
  consumer and is not breaking. Private or ignored packages are outside the
  published compatibility promise. Promotion from a private package into a
  published package is additive from the published side.
- **FR3 — Released contracts include behavior, not only types.** Compatibility
  covers public exports and import paths; requiredness, accepted values, defaults,
  return types, callbacks, and error behavior; documented interaction and
  accessibility behavior; stable CLI command names, options, exit behavior, and
  machine-readable schemas; and other explicitly documented public extension
  points. Internal implementation, undocumented markup, and source layout are not
  stable merely because a consumer can observe them.
- **FR4 — Preserved old usage is nonbreaking.** A rename or replacement is
  nonbreaking when the old released call, import, option, identifier, or input
  continues to work with equivalent meaning through a compatibility alias or
  adapter. A deprecation may warn and point to the replacement, but removing that
  compatibility path is the breaking event.
- **FR5 — Additive and victim-free contract restorations are nonbreaking.** New
  optional capabilities, new components, new commands, broader accepted inputs, and
  new templates are nonbreaking when old usage is unchanged. A fix that restores an
  already-documented contract is nonbreaking only when no valid consumer of the
  released faulty behavior must change. When a supported consumer relies on that
  behavior and the correction breaks the consumer, FR32–FR35 classify it as an
  incompatible fix even though the implementation violated authority. A proposal
  that intentionally replaces the documented contract is not a fix.
- **FR6 — Risk does not override compatibility.** Low adoption, low likelihood,
  engineering approval, or confidence that affected callers are uncommon does not
  make an incompatible released contract nonbreaking. Conversely, implementation
  size, visual scope, or review difficulty does not make a compatible change
  breaking.
- **FR7 — Changeset tags and lifecycle metadata are orthogonal.** Existing primary
  tags remain the authoring vocabulary: corrections use `[fix]`, compatible
  capabilities and replacement-first staging use `[feat]` or the established narrower
  tag, approved removals use `[breaking]`, and confined experiments use
  `[experimental]`. New compatibility and lifecycle classification MUST be additive
  machine-readable metadata, not a replacement tag. A victim-free correction is
  `[fix]` plus `compatible` or `contract-restoring` metadata and a patch bump. A
  behavior-correcting incompatibility is `[fix]` plus `incompatible-fix`, `IFIX-*`, and
  `CLN-*` metadata and uses the incompatible version tier. Replacement-first
  deprecation is `[feat]` plus `deprecation`, `DEP-*`, and `CLN-*` metadata and remains
  patch-compatible while old usage works. Approved removal is `[breaking]` plus
  `planned-removal`, its applicable lifecycle id, and `CLN-*`. While Astryx packages
  remain on `0.x`, the incompatible tier is minor; compatible work is patch.
  Documentation-only, test-only, and private-package-only changes need no Changeset.
  Existing Changesets keep their current tag and validated bump semantics and MUST NOT
  be mass-migrated; the additive metadata is required only when work enters a lifecycle
  defined here. `pnpm changeset:new` remains the authoring path, and
  `pnpm check:changesets` validates tag, metadata, evidence, and bump together once the
  additive schema is implemented. Classify each published package update in
  multi-package work. A fixed-group version-only co-bump needs no Changeset entry by
  itself, but a generated dependency or peer-range edit is part of that package's
  update and must be classified and named. When primary tags differ, use separate
  Changesets so each package retains its own author-facing category.
- **FR8 — Migration evidence matches the affected surface.** Every planned removal
  and incompatible fix names the old valid usage, the replacement or corrected
  behavior, and how consumers migrate. Supply an `astryx upgrade` codemod when
  consumer source, configuration, metadata, or project files can be rewritten
  mechanically. When no rewrite is possible, preserve an explicit compatibility
  adapter or provide concrete replacement instructions and record why a codemod would
  be vacuous. Codemods follow `spec:AST-040` and include positive, negative, and
  second-run idempotence fixtures plus downstream proof.
- **FR9 — Template slugs are mutable catalog data.** A template slug identifies an
  entry in the current template catalog; it is data about that template, not a
  contractual CLI API. Renaming a slug is nonbreaking even when
  `astryx template <old-slug>` no longer resolves. The Changeset and release note
  describe the catalog rename so builders can find the new value, but the rename
  does not use the `[breaking]` category or require an alias or codemod.
- **FR10 — Template content and metadata are expected to evolve.** Adding a
  template, rebuilding its starter source, or changing its slug, human-facing
  name, description, category, keywords, or example data is nonbreaking while the
  CLI's stable command and machine-readable schema contracts remain compatible.
  Generated starter code is not promised byte-for-byte stability across releases,
  and existing projects are not rewritten when a template improves.
- **FR11 — The CLI contract surrounds the catalog.** The `template` command name,
  supported options, exit behavior, and machine-readable response schema are
  contractual surfaces under FR3. Individual catalog values returned through that
  schema, including template slugs, names, descriptions, categories, keywords, and
  starter content, are not independently stable API identifiers.
- **FR12 — Supported inter-package ranges are contracts.** For an update to a
  published package, its latest stable release's documented installation scenarios
  and declared dependency or peer ranges define the supported companion package
  versions. The update is breaking for that package when upgrading it alone makes
  any such combination stop working unchanged, including by narrowing or raising
  the range. A coordinated upgrade that works does not change that classification.
  A dependency bump is not breaking when every previously supported combination
  keeps working. Keep every previously supported version in range and provide an
  adapter when needed; otherwise classify the narrower or higher-floor range as
  breaking, describe the range change in its Changeset release note, and meet FR8's
  migration obligation.
- **FR13 — Stable machine schemas project every field.** A stable CLI response
  contract includes fields inside discriminated `data` entries as well as the
  outer envelope. Every field is present in the canonical response type, contract
  tests, text projection where the command provides one, and complete
  consumer-facing schema documentation. Adding an optional field is nonbreaking
  when old consumers continue unchanged, but it remains a public schema update and
  does not bypass current-authority review or documentation.
- **FR14 — No supported CLI behavior is hidden.** Any Astryx CLI behavior
  available in a supported flow—including behavior selected automatically and
  behavior selected by an Astryx-owned control—is a public surface and MUST be
  documented and discoverable. Every caller-settable control that changes command
  selection, work, output, side effects, or exit behavior is part of that surface,
  whether spelled as a command, option, positional argument, package field, or
  configuration key. The CLI MUST NOT define or read an Astryx-owned environment
  variable for any purpose. A variable is Astryx-owned when Astryx defines its
  semantics, regardless of its name or prefix; standard platform variables remain
  outside this prohibition unless Astryx assigns them an Astryx-specific meaning.
  Automation MUST use the documented programmatic API.
  Public controls MUST define their accepted values, default, precedence and
  interactions, error behavior, and a representative invocation. Commands and
  options MUST appear in generated help and the machine-readable manifest.
  Automatic behavior and other controls MUST either appear there or be linked from
  those discovery surfaces to consumer documentation. A
  normal invocation mode MUST have a documented command, option, or configuration
  surface. Private test hooks and maintainer rollout gates MAY affect tests,
  diagnostics, or staged availability without becoming public controls, but they MUST
  NOT use environment variables, require action from supported consumers, or serve as
  the sole interface to a supported mode. The user-facing behavior they gate remains
  subject to this requirement once supported.
- **FR15 — Global controls require CLI-wide value and semantics.** An option is
  global when the root parser accepts it across commands or the manifest lists it in
  `globalOptions`. A new behavior-changing option MAY be global only when it
  represents one coherent CLI-wide invariant, solves a demonstrated
  supported-consumer need that a narrower surface cannot solve, and has defined,
  meaningful, non-no-op behavior for every executable command and subcommand. The proposal MUST enumerate those surfaces
  from generated help and the machine-readable manifest and state the control's
  behavior, output or error effect, and verification for each one. A command on
  which the control has no meaningful effect is evidence that the proposed scope is too broad. A behavior that applies to only part of the
  CLI MUST be placed on the nearest command, command group, or programmatic API that
  owns it. The same name MUST keep the same meaning throughout that scope, and names
  MUST describe the exact controlled capability rather than make broad claims such as
  `safe`, `secure`, `trusted`, or `isolated`. A safety or trust control MUST also
  define its trust boundary and fail closed before untrusted input can execute or
  cause a side effect.
- **FR16 — Cross-cutting guarantees define and close their boundary.** A claim that
  prevents a class of execution, data access, or side effect MUST define the trusted
  inputs, denied actions, and the points where protection begins and ends. It MUST
  cover every current entry point and fail closed for an unknown or newly added
  extension point.
- **FR17 — Suppressed work is observable.** When a safety or reduced-capability
  control intentionally omits a normally available source, capability, or unit of
  work, every successful machine-readable result MUST identify the active mode and
  what category was omitted. Human-readable output MUST project the same fact. A
  partial or empty result MUST NOT look like an ordinary complete success. If the
  operation cannot produce a useful conforming result, it MUST return a stable
  structured error and, for the CLI, a nonzero exit code before any write or external
  side effect.
- **FR18 — Programmatic controls are explicit and invocation-scoped.** A
  programmatic control MUST be an explicit API input and MUST NOT depend on ambient
  mutable process state. Concurrent calls MUST be able to select different values
  independently. When the CLI and programmatic API expose the same control, they MUST
  share accepted values, defaults, precedence, observable behavior, and error
  semantics.
- **FR19 — Configuration is admitted only on evidence.** A new configuration key,
  or a new accepted value that changes CLI behavior, MUST be justified by a
  reproducible supported-consumer case in which automatic detection and
  established project conventions produce the wrong result. The proposal MUST
  record that case and the convention it tried first. When an established
  convention or automatic detection can express the need, the CLI MUST use it
  instead of adding configuration. Configuration MUST NOT duplicate a value the
  CLI can derive.
- **FR20 — Integration contributions compose predictably and visibly.** A
  configuration setting MAY accept contributions from integrations only when its
  entry in the public configuration contract (the exported `AstryxConfig` type
  and the configuration schema reference consumers read through the CLI) states:
  that integrations may contribute; the exact form of a contribution; how the app
  value and all contributions combine, and in what order; the one documented
  control through which an app refuses inherited contributions; and what happens
  when a contribution fails. The setting owns that rule; an integration cannot
  change it. An integration declares each contribution statically in its
  integration module, either as a field of the exported `AstryxIntegration`
  manifest type or as a documented named export, and the integration authoring
  reference documents that form. Importing an integration module MUST NOT
  contribute anything as a side effect. The CLI MUST let a caller inspect the
  effective value of each such setting and the source of each part (the app or a
  named integration) through a documented command or programmatic API. Unless a
  setting's contract states and justifies otherwise: app and integration
  contributions combine rather than replace one another; the app's own value
  applies first, then integrations in their resolved order; a failing
  contribution is skipped without removing the others or changing the command's
  result; the app refuses all inherited contributions through one documented
  control; and loading the project more than once in one invocation applies each
  contribution once. No integration contribution can remove or weaken a value
  supplied by the app or by another integration. When a setting protects the
  project, a failed contribution MUST fail closed instead of being skipped.
- **FR21 — Experimental APIs are explicit and opt-in before publication.** A
  public surface inside a stable published package is outside the stable
  compatibility promise only when its first stable release exposes it through a
  canonical experimental boundary and marks it in both declarations and consumer
  documentation. On an existing stable component, experimental props and callbacks
  live inside one optional `experimental` prop object; omitting that object preserves
  the component's stable defaults and behavior. Experimental hooks, functions, and
  types use the owning component's `/experimental` import subpath and are not
  re-exported from the package root or the component's ordinary subpath. Declarations
  carry `@experimental`; authored docs carry machine-readable
  `stability: 'experimental'` metadata and state that the surface may change or be
  removed in a patch release. Prose-only warnings and reviewer knowledge do not
  establish this boundary.
- **FR22 — Experimental changes are patch-level and stay confined.** Adding,
  changing, renaming, or removing an explicitly experimental surface uses an
  `[experimental]` Changeset and a patch bump. An incompatibility confined to that
  boundary is `[experimental]`, not `[breaking]`; the Changeset authoring and
  validation process MUST derive and enforce a patch bump for the category even when
  the experimental surface changes incompatibly. Its release note names the affected
  surface and replacement when one exists. A compatibility alias is optional; a
  codemod is supplied when a mechanical migration would materially reduce caller
  work. This exception never covers a change to stable defaults, stable runtime or
  accessibility behavior, ordinary import paths, non-experimental props, or stable
  CLI commands and machine schemas; those changes follow FR1–FR8. A released stable
  surface cannot be retroactively demoted to experimental.
- **FR23 — Promotion creates a stable contract deliberately.** Promotion is an
  owner-approved change that removes the experimental marker, exposes the settled
  prop, callback, hook, function, or type on its normal stable surface, and uses a
  `[feat]` Changeset. From that release forward, FR1–FR8 protect the promoted surface.
  Moving a component API out of the `experimental` prop object or moving an export
  out of a component's `/experimental` subpath names the stable replacement and
  supplies a codemod when the rewrite is mechanical. Keeping a deprecated
  experimental alias for a transition is encouraged but is not itself part of the
  new stable promise.
- **FR24 — Experimental status is verified per public surface.** Release review
  compares the previous published surface with current declarations and authored
  docs, verifies that their experimental markers agree, and rejects an
  `[experimental]` Changeset when any incompatible delta reaches a stable surface.
  Integration-theme contribution capability remains the one grandfathered surface;
  no other released surface may be enrolled retroactively. Its contribution
  metadata, discovery, and authoring contract may evolve in patch releases until an
  explicit promotion removes the marker. This prohibition does not turn an
  unpublished field or behavior into stable API merely because an adjacent feature
  was released. Integration-template replacement-specific fields and behavior—its
  `replaces` declaration, replacement selection, optional list projection, and
  expanded conflict fields—remain pre-publication surfaces under FR2 until their first
  stable release; that classification is not experimental enrollment. Previously
  released same-id conflict warning behavior remains stable. The surrounding stable
  CLI command names, options, exit behavior, and machine-readable envelope remain
  protected under FR3 and FR13.
- **FR25 — Stable Core and every published stable package default to compatibility.**
  Outside approved cleanup, changes to behavior, types, exports, CSS or tokens,
  documented markup or selectors, accessibility semantics, persistence, CLI,
  configuration, schemas, build tooling, contractual documentation operations, and
  package files MUST be additive, implementation-equivalent, or a victim-free
  contract restoration under FR5. Documentation catalog names and routes follow
  FR45. An internal label, low adoption, or lack of a source-level API change does
  not weaken this rule.
- **FR26 — Public lifecycle state is explicit.** Each public surface is
  `experimental`, `stable`, `correction-transition`, `deprecated`,
  `cleanup-approved`, or `removed`; private and unreleased surfaces remain outside the
  published lifecycle. Stable cannot become experimental. Deprecated and
  correction-transition behavior remains supported until its exact cleanup item is
  approved. A completed correction returns its surviving behavior to stable.
- **FR27 — Experimental isolation covers every surface kind.** Whole experimental
  components remain in the private canary-only Lab package governed by the public
  Component Lifecycle. FR21 continues to govern stable-component props and exports.
  Experimental CLI controls use a dedicated experimental namespace; configuration
  uses an experimental object; CSS and tokens use dedicated experimental exports and
  names; persistence uses a feature- and schema-versioned experimental namespace;
  build tooling uses experimental exports/configuration; and docs use marked
  experimental routes. An omitted opt-in MUST leave stable defaults, output, routes,
  data, and behavior unchanged. Promotion requires owner approval and a `[feat]`
  Changeset; withdrawal uses `[experimental]` and MUST prove no stable spillover.
- **FR28 — Deprecation is replacement-first, actionable, and machine-readable.** A
  deprecation patch ships the working replacement while old usage remains equivalent.
  Before a surface enters `deprecated`, its supported modernization route MUST be
  available: an exact migration command or codemod when the rewrite is mechanical, or
  ordered and testable instructions when it is not. A public record assigns a stable
  `DEP-*` id and a distinct `CLN-*` cleanup id and names the package, surface kind, old
  contract, replacement, direct authority, warning, migration, codemod or non-mechanical
  reason, downstream proof, state, and target plan. Prose alone does not create removal
  eligibility.
- **FR29 — Deprecation adds no production-runtime behavior.** Marking a surface
  deprecated MUST NOT add a production runtime branch, log, byte, network action,
  changed render, or changed output. Compatibility code needed to keep an already
  released old contract working is separate from warning delivery and MUST preserve
  that contract. A development-only runtime diagnostic is permitted only when runtime
  information is necessary to explain an ambiguous coexistence state, such as both an
  old and replacement prop being supplied; it explains the direct owner's precedence
  rule and is not the primary deprecation channel.
- **FR29a — Warnings live at the earliest accurate authoring surface.** TypeScript
  declarations use static `@deprecated` metadata. Build-interpreted source and
  configuration warn in the authoring, validation, or build reader that can name the
  exact source use. CLI commands and options expose the deprecation id and replacement
  in their machine result and emit at most one human-readable stderr warning per
  invocation. CSS and tokens use static diagnostics. Rendered applications never emit
  a warning merely because a deprecated surface is used. Warnings MUST NOT change a
  successful exit status, canonical output, machine-readable stdout, generated output,
  or rendered behavior.
- **FR29b — Guidance teaches one modern path.** Every warning names the `DEP-*` id,
  exact replacement, stable versioned instructions, and exact migration command when
  one exists. Maintained API docs, generated docs, templates, examples, stories,
  starter output, and agent-facing guidance teach only the replacement. Explicit
  reference remains available for the deprecated surface, visibly labeled with the
  same replacement and modernization route. A warning MUST NOT ship before those
  instructions and that route exist.
- **FR29c — Modernization is safe and verifiable.** A mechanical migration is
  previewable, idempotent, evidence-scoped, and complete under `spec:AST-040`; it
  preserves the old observable result as its baseline and reports every uncertain or
  blocked case. Non-mechanical migration gives short, ordered, testable instructions
  rather than saying only to update manually. The direct owner names the applicable
  source, type, build, runtime, visual, accessibility, and CLI proof. Maintained Astryx
  packages and authoring surfaces migrate in the deprecation patch.
- **FR29d — Each public surface projects the lifecycle without inventing another one.**
  Whole components remain exported, renderable, accessible, themeable, and explicitly
  discoverable, but leave recommendations and copyable examples; their exports and
  docs carry the replacement and modernization route, with no render-time deprecation
  warning. Deprecated props and values keep old-only behavior, declare deterministic
  old-plus-new precedence, and statically name the replacement; codemods rewrite proven
  static uses and report spreads or dynamic expressions they cannot prove. Theme API
  fields, helpers, tokens, targets, and source keep identical normalization and rendered
  output; declarations use `@deprecated`, and theme build or validation reports exact
  source uses without `defineTheme`, theme mounting, or applications warning at
  runtime. Deprecated CLI commands and options remain accepted with their released
  exit status, canonical stdout, JSON envelope, and side effects; help and explicit
  lookup label them, human mode warns once on stderr, machine mode carries the
  deprecation metadata, and generated examples use the replacement. When old and new
  CLI controls coexist, their direct command contract defines precedence or rejects
  the ambiguous combination identically in text and JSON modes.
- **FR30 — Deprecation minima come only from direct authority.** This global spec
  imposes no elapsed-time or release-count minimum. The structural minimum is that the
  final patch preserves old and new behavior together. A direct current spec MAY
  require a duration or number of stable releases for its own surface; the `DEP-*`
  record cites that exact requirement and CI enforces it. Release cadence MUST NOT be
  interpreted as a deprecation clock or eligibility gate.
- **FR31 — Cleanup is one-to-one with approved ids and proven modernization.** A
  removal or default switch is allowed only when its applicable lifecycle record id
  (`DEP-*` for deprecation or `IFIX-*` for correction) and distinct `CLN-*` id appear in
  the frozen minor manifest. Each incompatible delta maps to exactly one applicable
  lifecycle record and one cleanup id, and each cleanup id maps to the old contract,
  replacement, migration, proof, and rollback. Cleanup evidence MUST show that
  maintained sources no longer teach or use the old surface and that a latest-stable
  consumer can follow the supported old-to-new route; uncertain cases remain reported
  rather than guessed. Newly introduced incompatibility cannot be legalized by adding
  it directly to a plan.
- **FR32 — Behavior-correcting incompatibility is a distinct classification.** An
  `incompatible-fix` exists when pre-existing current authority proves released
  behavior wrong, unsafe, or nonconforming AND a valid latest-stable consumer relies
  on that behavior such that the correction breaks code, interaction, persisted data,
  output, or a supported workflow. Its primary Changeset tag remains `[fix]`, with
  additive `incompatible-fix` classification metadata, an `IFIX-*` id, and a distinct
  `CLN-*` cleanup id. It is not an ordinary patch-eligible fix and MUST NOT be recast as
  a generic `[breaking]` removal. A visible correction with no valid released victim
  remains `[fix]` with `compatible` or `contract-restoring` metadata under FR5.
- **FR33 — Incompatible-fix evidence and approval are complete.** Before approval,
  the `IFIX-*` record names the pre-existing expected authority, a latest-stable
  reproducer for actual behavior, affected users and supported callsites or inputs,
  an old/new compatibility matrix, coexistence analysis, migration, codemod or exact
  non-mechanical reason, downstream proof, rollback, and harm from both delaying and
  applying the correction. Without pre-existing authority, the proposal is a new
  contract decision. The direct contract owner approves the expected behavior and
  classification; the release owner approves the `IFIX-*`/`CLN-*` pair in the plan.
- **FR34 — Incompatible fixes use a corrective lifecycle.** FR26 governs the state of
  each public surface; the `IFIX-*` record tracks `proposed`, `approved`,
  `transition-shipped`, `cleanup-approved`, `corrected`, `monitoring`, and `closed`.
  `proposed` or `approved` leaves the released surface `stable`.
  `transition-shipped` maps the coexisting old and corrected paths to
  `correction-transition`. `cleanup-approved` maps the old path to
  `cleanup-approved` while the corrected path remains `correction-transition`.
  `corrected`, `monitoring`, or `closed` maps the surviving corrected contract to
  `stable` and the eliminated old path to `removed`. When safe, a patch preserves the
  old default while shipping the corrected opt-in or adapter, warning, migration, and
  codemod. The paired minor changes the default or removes the old behavior only
  through the approved `CLN-*`. An incompatible fix cannot enter the minor as an
  incidental compatible fix or unrelated cleanup.
- **FR35 — Emergency correction is narrow and never relabeled as a patch.** Only
  urgent security, privacy, severe accessibility, or comparable critical ongoing
  harm MAY bypass replacement-first coexistence or ordinary scheduling. Waiting must
  materially extend the harm; no additive mitigation, containment, adapter, or safe
  rollout may be available; the contract owner and relevant incident owner must
  approve a dedicated record; public-safe incident evidence and restricted
  attestation must justify urgency; exact-main quality and migration gates still run;
  and the release contains no unrelated feature, cleanup, or incompatible fix.
  Migration ships with the release; an incomplete emergency codemod records an owner,
  bounded follow-up, fixtures, and delivery target. Rollback never restores known
  harmful behavior: use containment or safe-forward correction.
- **FR36 — Minor frequency is planning guidance, not eligibility.** Plan minors
  generally no more often than once every fourteen calendar days. The plan records
  the interval from the prior minor for owner review. CI reports the interval but
  MUST NOT derive deprecation eligibility, a final-patch-to-minor wait, or an
  exception requirement from it.
- **FR37 — Every minor has an owner-approved public plan and freeze.** Before freeze,
  the plan names the target, final-patch baseline procedure, exact `CLN-*` items,
  migrations, codemods, downstream proof, allowed compatible fixes, exact-main gates,
  release notes, rollback, and recovery. Changing cleanup items after freeze
  invalidates the plan. Operational runbooks may add execution detail but cannot
  authorize or widen cleanup.
- **FR38 — The final patch is the paired minor's locked baseline.** Publish the final
  patch with deprecated and correction-transition behavior still working, record its
  exact source and package/docsite/visual/contract receipts, then lock that baseline.
  The paired minor MAY follow sequentially and immediately when ready and explicitly
  authorized; no wait exists unless a direct authority requires one.
- **FR39 — Every final-patch-to-minor delta has exactly one class.** The diff MUST
  partition into: (a) approved `CLN-*` cleanup removals or corrections; (b) a closed
  list of version, changelog, lockfile-integrity, tag, provenance, digest,
  build-timestamp, and source-map metadata; or (c) independently patch-compatible
  fixes under FR40. Strict equivalence is the target. Unrelated features, additive
  product capabilities, incompatible fixes outside approved corrective cleanup,
  refactors with public deltas, and unclassified changes are prohibited.
- **FR40 — Compatible fixes may be disclosed separately in the minor.** Each has its
  own `[fix]` Changeset, current authority or standard, latest-stable regression test,
  representative unchanged paths, downstream proof, and a manifest entry separate
  from cleanup ids. If the fix lands before final-patch lock, include it in both
  releases. If it lands after publication or lock, it MAY enter the minor as a
  disclosed compatible delta; do not recut the final patch solely for bookkeeping.
  CI MUST independently prove patch eligibility. Release notes separate cleanup from
  compatible fixes.
- **FR41 — Records use closed schemas.** The declaration schema preserves the existing
  primary Changeset tag and adds separate compatibility classification and lifecycle
  fields. Deprecations require `DEP-*` and `CLN-*`; incompatible fixes require
  `IFIX-*` and `CLN-*`; the minor plan carries baseline receipts, cleanup items,
  compatible fixes, release-metadata deltas, owner approval, exact-main gates, and
  rollback; and the equivalence receipt carries final and candidate digests plus
  `unclassifiedDeltas`. Unknown fields, duplicate ids, reused cleanup ids, missing
  evidence, tag/classification contradictions, and one delta mapped more or less than
  once fail.
- **FR42 — Contributors declare compatibility intent once.** Every pull request and its
  Changesets share one machine-readable declaration with the existing primary tag,
  classification, authority, affected surface kinds, experimental ids, deprecation
  ids, correction ids, cleanup ids, and minor plan. Closed classifications are
  `not-published`, `compatible`, `contract-restoring`, `experimental`, `deprecation`,
  `planned-removal`, and `incompatible-fix`. Classification is orthogonal to the
  established tag and MUST NOT introduce `[deprecation]` or `[incompatible-fix]` as
  authoring categories. Existing Changesets need no backfill. Contributors state
  intent; maintainers resolve missing authority. External contributors are not
  required to invent policy.
- **FR43 — CI validates semantics, not labels.** Pull-request CI compares latest
  stable to head to establish released victims and base to head to attribute deltas.
  Release CI compares final patch to paired minor and assigns every delta exactly once
  to cleanup, release metadata, or compatible fix. It checks exports/types, runtime,
  CSS/tokens, DOM/accessibility/visual/RTL, CLI/help/routes/schema, persistence, docs,
  package files, supported package combinations, old-client/new-metadata behavior,
  fixed-group membership, required evidence, and tag/classification/bump coupling.
  Plain failures name the victim, missing evidence, and exact repair path.
- **FR44 — Exact-main release gates and rollback preserve one identity.** The final
  patch and paired minor each use one immutable source identity for build, package
  artifacts, gate receipts, tag, publish, and release record. Missing authority,
  manifest coverage, required migration, exact-main evidence, or any unclassified
  delta aborts the cut. Partial publishing resumes the same bytes. A bad release rolls
  forward with a compatible patch that restores aliases or the prior safe
  compatibility mode; critical-harm recovery follows FR35 and never restores the
  harmful behavior.
- **FR45 — Documentation catalog display names and routes are mutable data.** A
  display name or docs-tree route identifies an entry in the current documentation
  catalog; it is not a contractual CLI operation or machine-readable schema. Renaming
  or moving an entry is nonbreaking even when its former value stops resolving, and
  requires no compatibility alias or codemod. Release metadata identifies the
  replacement value. The `docs` command name, options, exit behavior, and response
  schemas remain contractual under FR3 and FR13. Template identifiers, slugs, display
  names, and names are outside this requirement and remain governed separately by FR9,
  FR11, and applicable registry identity contracts.
- **FR46 — Main targets a patch by default.** Between releases, main is heading
  for the next patch of the version its published packages already share. That
  default needs no file, no ceremony, and no per-change approval: it is simply
  what main is for, and the overwhelming majority of work ships under it.
- **FR47 — A minor is scheduled explicitly, by an owner, before its work
  lands.** Main targets a minor only while a release owner has said so in the
  repository, naming the version and the day it is scheduled for. That statement
  is the only thing that switches the mode. Pending Changesets MUST NOT switch
  it: a `[breaking]` entry waiting to merge is the work the mode governs, never
  evidence for it, and treating it as evidence would let the release retarget
  itself. The order is fixed — schedule the minor, then land the breaking work.
- **FR48 — While main targets a patch, incompatible work is refused.** A
  Changeset carrying the `[breaking]` category, or the `planned-removal` or
  `incompatible-fix` classification of FR42, is inadmissible and MUST be
  rejected before merge. The admissible route is FR28's replacement-first
  deprecation: ship the working replacement, keep old usage equivalent, take the
  patch bump, and let the removal land once a minor is scheduled. This gate
  decides patch-versus-minor admission and nothing else; the lifecycle
  conditions of FR28, FR31, FR32, and FR37, and every review and release
  requirement outside this record, continue to apply on their own terms and are
  neither restated nor enforced here.
- **FR49 — The schedule fails closed.** A target statement admits incompatible
  work only when it can be read with certainty and still applies. It is refused
  when it is malformed or carries anything beyond the version and the date; when
  its version is not the minor successor of the version the published packages
  share, so that the schedule and the repository disagree; when its scheduled
  day has passed, so that a forgotten statement cannot hold the mode open
  indefinitely; and when the published packages do not all carry one identical
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version, so that there is no base to check it against. A
  prerelease or canary identifier is publication metadata and is never that
  base. In each case main stays on its patch default rather than inheriting a
  mode from an input nobody can trust.
- **FR50 — Returning to a patch target is ordinary cleanup.** Once the scheduled
  minor has shipped, removing the target statement is part of the normal
  post-release setup that readies main for the next release, alongside consuming
  the Changesets. No separate approval is needed to go back to the default, and
  FR49's expiry means a statement left behind stops admitting work on its own.
  A rejection names the version main is targeting and both ways forward —
  deprecate now under FR28 and keep the patch, or schedule the minor under
  FR47 — and names no particular version, surface, or contributor as a special
  case, so a contributor who has never read this spec can act on it.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: every published Astryx package and stable CLI
  release.
- Unsupported behavior: private packages, unreleased branch state, canary-only
  surfaces, and surfaces that meet FR21's explicit experimental contract carry no
  stable compatibility promise.
- Browser evidence: not applicable to the classification itself; a browser-owned
  compatibility claim still follows the governing component or platform spec.

## Authority relationships

This spec owns compatibility classification, lifecycle state, release-pair delta
classes, and the evidence that admits them. It delegates narrower questions rather
than restating them:

- [`spec:AST-002` — Public API admission and operation shape](../AST-002/spec.md)
  owns whether a public API concept should exist and its semantic shape.
- [`architecture:public-component-api` — Public component API](../../architecture/public-component-api.md)
  owns the stable component contract; this spec owns how it evolves.
- [`architecture:cli-surface` — CLI surface architecture](../../architecture/cli-surface.md)
  and [`spec:AST-042` — CLI command admission and programmatic parity system spec](../AST-042-cli-command-admission/spec.md)
  own CLI structure, admission, and parity; this spec owns compatibility and
  release transition.
- [`architecture:theme-tokens` — Theme token architecture](../../architecture/theme-tokens.md)
  owns token semantics; this spec owns compatibility and experimental isolation.
- [`spec:AST-013` — Browser and platform support system spec](../AST-013/spec.md)
  owns support floors and fallbacks; this spec owns release treatment of a support
  reduction.
- [`spec:AST-035` — Integration template replacement system spec](../AST-035/spec.md)
  owns template-replacement semantics. This spec classifies each field and behavior
  against the latest stable release: unpublished replacement-specific surfaces follow
  FR2, while previously released same-id conflict warning behavior remains stable.
- [`spec:AST-040` — Evidence-based consumer file modification system spec](../AST-040-consumer-file-modification/spec.md)
  owns what a codemod may edit and the evidence it requires; this spec owns when a
  migration must supply one.
- [`spec:AST-010` — Structured percentage useResizable configuration system spec](../AST-010/spec.md)
  and [`spec:AST-043` — Date and time input presentation system spec](../AST-043-input-presentation/spec.md)
  own their concrete mappings and any surface-specific deprecation minimums.
- [`spec:AST-030` — Positive CI surface routing system spec](../AST-030/spec.md)
  owns pull-request lane routing; this spec owns the compatibility checks each
  affected surface must receive and the exact-main release gate.
- [`spec:AST-039` — Integration contribution descriptor system spec](../AST-039/spec.md)
  is a related draft, not authority. If promoted, it links its compatibility readers
  and removals to this lifecycle.
- The public [Component Lifecycle](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/wiki/Component-Lifecycle)
  owns whole-component Lab-to-Core readiness. Lab remains the private canary-only
  incubation boundary; this spec owns the compatibility effect of promotion.
- The public [API Conventions](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/wiki/API-Conventions),
  [Distribution](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/wiki/Distribution), and
  [Release Process](https://github.com/facebook/astryx/wiki/Release-Process) pages
  are operational projections. When they discuss compatibility lifecycle, they MUST
  link here and cannot create competing rules.
- [`.changeset/config.json`](../../../.changeset/config.json),
  [`scripts/check-changesets.mjs`](../../../scripts/check-changesets.mjs), and
  [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) implement fixed
  grouping, declaration validation, and checks. Their current behavior is not policy
  when it differs from this spec. The `fixed` group in that config is why one
  incompatible Changeset moves every published package, and `check-changesets.mjs`
  is where the FR48 admission gate and its FR50 message belong; neither file may
  narrow or widen the rule it implements.

The direct current owner decides the intended product contract. This spec decides how
that contract may change in a stable release. The public Release Process decides how
an eligible release is operated. A direct spec cannot waive compatibility silently;
it names the applicable `DEP-*`, `IFIX-*`, and `CLN-*` records when its transition is
incompatible.

## Current-state impact

Public lifecycle classification remains in force with these operational effects:

- stable changes default to compatible patch treatment;
- experimental containment extends to every public surface kind;
- deprecations are replacement-first, machine-readable, and cleanup-owned; warnings
  stay at authoring surfaces, production runtime stays unchanged, and an executable
  modernization route precedes warning delivery;
- planned minors use a locked final-patch baseline while admitting only approved
  cleanup, closed release metadata, and independently patch-compatible fixes;
- minor frequency remains planning guidance and creates no deprecation or pair wait;
- contributor declarations preserve established Changeset tags while adding semantic
  lifecycle metadata and require no migration of existing Changesets;
- documentation catalog display names and routes remain mutable data while the stable
  `docs` command and machine-readable schemas stay contractual; and
- exact-main release comparison rejects unclassified deltas.

Main targets a patch by default. A scheduled minor makes breaking work admissible
before that work lands; a pending `[breaking]` Changeset cannot retarget its own
release. Because the fixed package group publishes as one version, this admission gate
prevents one unapproved removal from moving the whole release to a minor. It does not
add a per-change approval path: lifecycle, cleanup, migration, and freeze requirements
remain independently enforceable.

These requirements alter no published package by themselves and need no Changeset.
Authoring helpers, validators, metadata projections, compatibility snapshots, release
workflows, and contributor guidance implement the contract. Until each projection
lands, maintainers apply its requirement in review and release approval.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Breaking means a released consumer must change

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-02`

Classify compatibility from the latest stable published contract and name the
consumer scenario that stops working. This makes labels predictable, keeps
unreleased and private experimentation free to change, and prevents low-risk but
incompatible edits from hiding in patch releases.

Rejected: classifying by implementation size, perceived risk, reviewer confidence,
or any observable difference. Those tests either miss real contract breakage or
freeze implementation details and data values that were never promised.

### DEC-2 — Template slugs and source are mutable catalog data

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-02`

Treat a template slug as data describing the current catalog entry, alongside its
name, description, category, keywords, and starter content. Those values may evolve
in patch releases, including a slug rename that makes the previous value stop
resolving. The release note should make the new value discoverable, but the change
is not `[breaking]` and needs no compatibility alias or codemod.

Keep the surrounding CLI operation contractual: incompatible changes to the
`template` command, its options, exit behavior, or machine-readable schema still
follow the normal breaking-change rule. This lets the template library improve
without confusing current catalog contents with the interface that serves them.

Rejected: treating a slug as stable API merely because it is interpolated into an
exact CLI invocation. That would freeze catalog data and discourage clearer naming
without protecting a contract the template system intends to make.

### DEC-3 — Package updates keep their own range promises

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-03`

Treat the latest stable package's declared dependency or peer range and documented
installation scenario as its compatibility promise. Consumers may upgrade that
package with any companion version the range still allows; a coordinated release
cannot require an undeclared lockstep upgrade. Classify the package update that
creates the mismatch. Supporting package updates keep their own classifications.
A coordinated breaking range change remains allowed when its Changeset release note
describes the new range and its FR8 migration tells consumers how to move.

Rejected: marking every dependency bump breaking, which would freeze compatible
maintenance, or calling an update nonbreaking merely because a coordinated upgrade
works, which would break supported independent consumers.

### DEC-4 — Stable CLI response fields receive complete projections

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-4`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-06`

Treat every field in a stable machine-readable CLI response—including nested
entry fields—as public schema. Keep its canonical type, contract tests, applicable
text output, and complete consumer documentation aligned in the same change.

An optional field addition may remain nonbreaking when old consumers continue
unchanged. That compatibility result does not make the field private or waive
current-authority and documentation requirements.

Rejected: documenting only the outer envelope, relying on implementation typedefs
as consumer documentation, or treating a response-entry field as mutable catalog
data merely because the value it carries may evolve.

### DEC-5 — Supported CLI behavior is never hidden

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-5`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Any Astryx CLI behavior available in a supported flow is public and must be
documented and discoverable, including behavior selected automatically. A control
that can change supported CLI behavior is public and must be documented and
discoverable. Its status follows the behavior it changes, not whether it is spelled
as a command, option, package field, or configuration key.

Use an option for invocation-scoped behavior, placed on the nearest command or
command group that owns it; a global option must meet FR15's CLI-wide evidence bar.
Use a documented configuration surface for persistent project behavior. Do not
introduce Astryx-owned environment variables, including aliases for another surface.
Automation uses the documented programmatic API. Private tests use injected test
seams instead of environment variables. A maintainer rollout gate may control staged
availability, but it is not a public user interface, must not use an environment
variable, and cannot be the only way to reach a supported mode. The user-facing
behavior it gates becomes subject to this requirement once supported.

Rejected: documented or undocumented environment-variable controls, naming a hidden
rollout gate as the user interface, or describing a behavior only in prose while
omitting it—or a direct link to its documentation—from generated help and the
machine-readable manifest.

### DEC-6 — Global CLI controls prove global value

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-6`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Treat a behavior-changing global control as a last resort, not as the default home for
invocation-scoped behavior. Because it changes every command, it requires current
system-spec authority before implementation. Its proposal must show one stable
invariant with meaningful behavior for every command, a supported-consumer need that
narrower command or API scope cannot satisfy, and a manifest-derived command matrix that verifies the claim. A
no-op or different meaning on any command means the control is scoped too broadly.

Put narrower behavior on the nearest command, command group, or programmatic API that
owns it. Name the control for the exact capability it changes rather than using broad
quality claims such as `safe`, `secure`, `trusted`, or `isolated`. A safety or trust
control also defines its trust boundary and fails closed before untrusted input can
execute or cause a side effect.

Rejected: making a control global because several implementations share a switch,
because root parsing is convenient, or because unrelated commands can silently ignore
it. Those approaches enlarge the public surface without establishing coherent value.

### DEC-7 — Cross-cutting controls are complete, observable, and per invocation

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-7`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Define a cross-cutting guarantee by its complete boundary, not by the current list of
implementation sites. Unknown and future extension points fail closed.

Make work omitted by a safety or reduced-capability mode part of the result contract
so a partial result cannot be mistaken for a complete one. When no useful result
remains, return a stable error before writes or external effects. Pass programmatic controls as explicit inputs, keep
them independent across concurrent calls, and preserve semantics across equivalent CLI
and API surfaces.

Rejected: best-effort interception of known loaders, silent fallback to partial or
empty results, process-global mutable switches, and separate CLI and API meanings. Each can
make the advertised guarantee false while the happy-path tests remain green.

### DEC-8 — Configuration is a last resort, and contributions compose

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-8`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-23`

Every configuration key is permanent public surface under FR3 and FR14, and it
asks every consumer to make a decision. A key often hides a gap in detection, so
detection and established conventions come first, and a new key needs a
reproduced case where they fail.

Integration contributions let one package set shared behavior once, as the
`debug` setting does for organization-wide debug logs, while the app keeps the
final say. The setting defines how contributions combine; an integration only
declares its contribution, in the documented form. Contributions combine with the
app value instead of replacing it, they are isolated from one another, each part
of the effective value can be traced to its source, and a protective setting
fails closed.

Rejected: adding a key because it is easy to add, a key that duplicates a
convention or a derivable value, an integration silently replacing an app value,
an integration defining its own merge rule, contributions made by import side
effects, and one broken integration disabling a setting for every app.

### DEC-9 — Existing stable components incubate APIs behind one explicit boundary

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-9`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-28`

Keep Lab as the canary-only home for an entire experimental component. When an
existing stable component needs to test a new prop or callback, put it inside the
component's optional `experimental` prop object so every callsite opts in visibly
and the ordinary prop namespace stays stable. Put experimental hooks, functions,
and types on the owning component's `/experimental` subpath. Mark the same surface
in declarations and authored docs, and keep stable defaults unchanged when the
experimental boundary is unused.

Allow those marked surfaces to evolve through `[experimental]` patch releases.
Promotion is a separate `[feat]` decision that moves the settled API onto its stable
surface; after that release the ordinary compatibility rules apply. Never use an
experimental marker to demote an already stable contract. Integration-theme
contributions remain the single explicitly recorded grandfathered surface because
they shipped before this declaration mechanism while still being introduced for early
iteration.

That retroactive-marker prohibition does not make unpublished additions stable by
association. Integration-template replacement-specific declarations, selection,
optional projection, and expanded conflict fields remain pre-publication under FR2;
their classification is not an experimental enrollment. The already released same-id
conflict warning behavior remains stable.

Rejected: moving a stable component into Lab to test one new API, scattering
`unstableFoo` names through its ordinary prop namespace, relying on prose warnings
that tooling cannot verify, treating every recently added API as implicitly
experimental, and retroactively marking another released stable surface unstable.

### DEC-10 — Replacement-first records own deprecation and cleanup

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-10`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-29`

Keep old and replacement behavior together in the final patch, identify each
transition with `DEP-*` and `CLN-*`, and permit removal only through the frozen minor
manifest. Direct authorities may impose a longer transition for their own surfaces;
release cadence never invents one.

Rejected: prose-only deprecation, silent removal, a global wait inferred from cadence,
and one cleanup id covering unrelated deltas.

### DEC-11 — Behavior-correcting incompatibility is not an ordinary fix

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-11`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-29`

A correction with a valid released victim keeps the `[fix]` Changeset tag and adds
`incompatible-fix` classification, an `IFIX-*` record, and an approved `CLN-*` item.
Pre-existing authority proves the expected behavior; latest-stable evidence proves the
victim. A victim-free restoration also uses `[fix]`, with `compatible` or
`contract-restoring` metadata and patch treatment. FR26 governs the public surface
while FR34 maps the `IFIX-*` record lifecycle to that surface state.

Rejected: treating every visible correction as breaking, using bare `[fix]` without
`incompatible-fix` metadata to hide a released victim, inventing an
`[incompatible-fix]` Changeset tag, or using generic `[breaking]` to avoid correction
evidence and rollback.

### DEC-12 — The paired minor admits only three delta classes

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-12`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-29`

Lock the final-patch baseline and classify every paired-minor delta as approved
cleanup, closed release metadata, or an independently patch-compatible fix. A fix
that lands after baseline lock may be disclosed in the minor without recutting the
patch solely for bookkeeping. Keep cleanup and compatible fixes separate in both the
manifest and release notes.

Rejected: unrelated features, unclassified deltas, an incompatible fix in the
compatible-fix lane, and strict byte identity that forces a needless replacement
final patch for an independently valid patch fix.

### DEC-13 — Cadence guides planning; readiness and authority gate the cut

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-13`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-29`

Plan minor releases generally no more often than once every fourteen calendar days,
but do not turn that interval into deprecation eligibility or a required wait between
the final patch and paired minor. A ready, authorized pair may publish sequentially.

Rejected: an inferred elapsed-time gate, a special exception merely to publish a
ready pair, and using cadence to waive replacement, migration, cleanup, or exact-main
evidence.

### DEC-14 — Documentation catalog display names and routes are mutable data

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-14`
**Decider:** `josephfarina`, `2026-09-29`

Treat a documentation catalog display name or tree route as data identifying a current
entry. It may change in a patch release even when its former value stops resolving.
Release metadata identifies the replacement; no compatibility alias or codemod is
required.

Keep the surrounding operation contractual: incompatible changes to the `docs`
command, its options, exit behavior, or machine-readable response schemas still
follow FR1–FR8 and FR13. Template identifiers, slugs, display names, and names remain
outside this documentation rule and follow FR9, FR11, and applicable registry identity
contracts.

Rejected: treating every route-shaped positional value as stable CLI API. That would
freeze documentation organization rather than protect the command and schema
contracts readers and automation rely on.

### DEC-15 — A minor is scheduled before its breaking work lands

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-15`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

Main targets a patch by default, and incompatible work is refused while it does. A
minor becomes admissible only after a release owner schedules it in the repository,
naming the version and the day. Scheduling comes first; the breaking work follows.

The order is the whole point. The publishable packages are a fixed group, so one
`[breaking]` Changeset moves every package to a new minor. If a pending Changeset
could establish the mode that admits it, the release would retarget itself and the
owner would learn the shape of the release from a merge. Requiring the schedule first
puts that decision back where it belongs, and makes an accidental breaking merge
impossible rather than merely discouraged.

Deliberately small. The statement carries a version and a date and nothing else: no
list of Changesets, no lifecycle ids, no per-change manifest, no second approval
path. This gate answers one question — is main on a patch or a scheduled minor — and
leaves every other requirement where it already lives. FR28's deprecation lifecycle,
FR31's cleanup mapping, FR37's release planning, and ordinary spec and code review
continue to apply on their own terms; none of them is restated or enforced here.

Rejected: deriving the mode from the pending Changesets. It reads as elegant — the
bumps already imply a version — but it is circular, because the entry being judged
would be its own authorization.

Rejected: a per-change authorization record enumerating each approved removal with
cleanup and lifecycle ids. It answers a question this gate is not asking, and it buys
accuracy at the cost of bureaucracy on every breaking change, when a scheduled day is
enough to stop the accident this exists to stop.

Rejected: leaving the schedule open-ended. A statement with no date would outlive its
release and quietly keep main in minor mode. Expiry makes a forgotten statement fail
back to the patch default instead of silently widening what may land.

### DEC-16 — Deprecation acts at authoring surfaces, not production runtime

**Reference:** `spec:AST-017/DEC-16`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-07`

A deprecation reaches a builder where the obsolete choice is authored: declarations,
generated reference, theme validation or build, CLI help and invocation, and supported
migration tooling. The working replacement and executable modernization route exist
before warnings begin. Maintained guidance teaches the replacement, while explicit
lookup keeps the deprecated surface and its exact route discoverable.

Production runtime behavior and bytes remain unchanged merely because a surface is
deprecated. The old contract continues working until its separately approved cleanup;
a runtime-only coexistence conflict may receive a development diagnostic explaining
the direct owner's precedence rule. Cleanup follows only after the migration can
preserve or explicitly account for every observable result it owns.

Rejected: a runtime compatibility flag or branch used only to acknowledge deprecation,
a warning without an available modernization path, copyable guidance that keeps
teaching the old surface, and a migration that guesses at uncertain consumer intent.
