| Public contract         | `Item` carries touch swipe actions. `swipeActions` declares, per side, the verbs a sideways drag uncovers as `ItemSwipeAction[]` — `label`, `icon`, `onActivate`, `variant`, `hasRemoval` — and `Item` renders the panel from them (DEC-1). `swipeBehavior` is `reveal` (rest open) or `commit` (fire on release) (DEC-2). The capability is `Item`'s, available on any row whose role permits interactive descendants — a `listitem`, a role-less row — and out of scope where it does not (`option`, `menuitem*`, a radio) (DEC-3). No hover reveal (DEC-4). No new DOM: the row's root translates and its panels counter-translate (DEC-5).        |
| Behavior                | On a coarse pointer a sideways drag moves the row and uncovers the side's panel. Under `reveal` (default) the row rests open so each action is tappable and a long drag fires the outermost; under `commit` the row slides out and the outermost fires; nothing rests. After an action fires the row springs back, or holds out when the action has `hasRemoval` — one bit the component cannot infer, independent of the model. The component waits for nothing afterwards. A short release springs back under both. A mouse never starts the drag; a mostly vertical drag stays the scroller's; a pointer anywhere outside a resting row closes it. |
| End-user impact         | A person on a phone gets the flick they expect on a mail row or a settings row, with the row's own look. Nothing changes for anyone else: a mouse, a keyboard, or a screen reader meets the row exactly as today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Builder impact          | One prop on `Item` (and so on `ListItem`), `swipeActions={{trailing: [{label: 'Archive', icon: <Icon icon={ArchiveIcon} />, onActivate: archive, hasRemoval: true}]}}`; optionally `swipeBehavior`. Every field is known before the gesture begins, so the component paints the panel from data. The group around the rows clips in the inline axis — `List` does it; any other host does it once. The consumer documentation states that a verb reachable only by swipe is unreachable by keyboard.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Compatibility/readiness | Additive: both props are absent by default; every current row keeps its DOM and paint exactly. Authority: `draft`; `approved_by` is `null`. No owner question is open.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Review checks           | Reject a hover-revealed panel; swipe actions on a row whose role forbids interactive descendants; a model restricted by host; `commit` with several entries on a side and no warning; a panel exposed to the tree while closed; any element added to `Item` for the panels; `overflow: hidden` on the group where `clip` is meant; a row exit or enter animation introduced under this record; `hasRemoval` read as an obligation, a warning, or a timing rule; a second adaptive media query.                                                                                                                                                        |

This table is a review projection; the body below is authoritative.

## Intent

On a phone, a person flicks a row sideways to get at a verb — archive,
delete, mark unread, select. Astryx rows do not flick. This record adds the gesture to `Item`, the row primitive, so a `ListItem`
and a bare `Item` in a product's own markup swipe the same way. The rule for where it is available is the row's role: a swipe panel's
controls are interactive descendants of the row, so swipe actions exist on
any row whose role permits them — a `listitem`, a row with no role at all —
and not on one whose role forbids them. That sorts the list row and the
standalone row in, and the option, menu-item and radio rows out, without
naming a component; a row type nobody has written yet sorts itself.

The gesture is touch-only and is an accelerator: it adds a faster path to a
verb on a coarse pointer and changes nothing on any other input. Each side's
verbs are declared as data — a label that names the state the verb reaches,
an icon, a handler, how it looks, and whether the row holds out afterwards —
so the component knows everything it needs before the finger moves: what to
paint, what to fire, and where the row rests when it is done. The row's own root moves
and its panels stay put, so no element is added to any row.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The public shape of `Item`'s swipe actions: `ItemSwipeAction` and its
  fields, the per-side arrays, and `swipeBehavior`.
- The rule for where swipe actions are available: the row's role.
- The two models, `reveal` and `commit`, meaning the same thing wherever
  swipe actions are available.
- The coarse-pointer behavior: rest or fire, the accelerator, where the row
  rests after an action, one open row at a time, and how a row closes.
- The anatomy the gesture uses: two out-of-flow positions on `Item`'s
  existing root, the root's translation and the panels' counter-translation,
  and the group's inline clip.
- The accessibility contract of the gesture itself: what the panel exposes
  while resting and while closed, and that the gesture touches nothing on a
  pointer that can hover.

**Why no existing record can hold it**

- [`architecture:interaction-modality`](../../architecture/interaction-modality.md)
  is `current` and owns the rule the gesture must respect — INV7 "essential
  actions remain reachable" — but owns no public API. A record carries one
  `authority` value, so adding unapproved API claims to it would present
  them as approved (`architecture:knowledge-contracts` INV1, INV14).
- `Item` has no component record. This record is the first durable decision
  about `Item`'s public surface; `component:Item`, when written, inherits
  these claims rather than re-deciding them. Of `Item`'s seven in-core renderers, six give the row a role that forbids
  interactive descendants and are out of scope; `ListItem` and a bare `Item` in caller markup — which the system's own
  templates render inside a `BottomSheet` and on a page — are the rows this
  record serves: two real consumers, one home, and the prop stays on the
  primitive (DEC-3).
- [`component:List`](../../../packages/core/src/List/List.spec.md) is
  `current` and owns List's geometry; it gains the inline clip and cites
  this record.
- [`spec:AST-002`](../AST-002/spec.md) owns admission: the caller owns which
  verbs earn a gesture and which model fits them, and the component cannot
  derive either.

## Non-goals

- **What else the row offers.** A row's visible controls — a menu or buttons
  in `endContent`, its own primary — are `Item`'s existing composition and
  are not governed, paired, or checked here. The consumer documentation
  states the obligation; the component does not police it.
- **A hover-revealed action panel on a fine pointer** (DEC-4).
- **Animating a row's exit or enter.** Not settled here: a row the caller
  removes after an action unmounts as any row does today. When it is
  settled, the likely form is imperative (`handleRef`, as `Selector` and
  `MultiSelector` expose open/close) so enter can be animated too. `hasRemoval` is not it: it says only where the row
  rests after an action, and a row that holds out and is never removed sits
  off-screen — the caller's bug, which that eventual API is what makes
  graceful.
- **A render prop for a custom panel.** Deferred, not foreclosed: a
  `render*`-shaped addition can land when a caller needs something the
  vocabulary cannot say (DEC-1).
- **Gesture tuning.** Axis-lock distance, commit ratio, fling velocity, slide
  and spring durations, resistance past the panel: behavior constants in
  source, not public API and not design tokens (the same ruling the touch
  press model received for its clocks).
- **Vertical swipes**, two-finger trackpad swipes, and a swipe whose only
  meaning is dismissal (Toast already has that in `useToastGesture`).
- **Public out-of-flow slots on `Item`.** Deliberately not admitted: the
  panel positions are internal, rendered from `swipeActions`. A second
  consumer — an accent bar, a slide-in checkbox, a drag handle — is a
  `component:Item` anatomy record with its own admission argument.
- **A programmatic open or close.** Not admitted: a swipe panel's open state
  belongs to the gesture, and the one coordination case met in practice — a
  resting row closing when a neighbour's drag starts — is already a pointer
  outside the row (FR7). No product has asked, and the row this gesture was modelled on exposes no
  such handle. If one ever does, `handleRef` is the established pattern to add
  it with, as `Selector` and `MultiSelector` expose open/close/toggle.
- **Rows whose role forbids interactive descendants.** Swipe actions are
  available on a row whose role permits interactive descendants, because a
  swipe panel's controls are interactive descendants of the row; a
  `listitem` and a role-less `Item` qualify, and "it'll just work" there. A
  row whose role forbids them is out of scope as a consequence: `option`
  (inside a `listbox`), `menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`, and
  a row that is the enlarged target of a native radio. This is a scope
  boundary, not a per-call or per-model restriction, so `swipeBehavior`
  means one thing everywhere swipe actions exist. In core today that
  excludes `SelectorOption`, the four `DropdownMenu` rows, and
  `RadioListItem`, and includes `ListItem` and every bare `Item`.
- Equivalent internal implementations remain valid when they satisfy this
  contract. Internal modules, files, function names, algorithms, data
  structures, storage layouts, manifests, journals, locks, transaction
  protocols, and CI job/workflow topology belong in architecture or
  implementation unless callers or interoperating systems intentionally depend
  on that exact mechanism as a public protocol.

| FR1 | `Item` MUST take its swipe actions as `swipeActions: {leading?: ItemSwipeAction[]; trailing?: ItemSwipeAction[]}`, where `ItemSwipeAction` is `{id?, label: string, icon?: ReactNode, onActivate, isDisabled?, variant?: 'neutral' \| 'accent' \| 'destructive', hasRemoval?: boolean}` with `variant` defaulting to `accent`. An entry MUST NOT carry a node the component renders as the control. `ListItem` MUST pass the prop through unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | DEC-1; `DropdownMenuItemData`; `useMenuPress.onActivate`; `ProgressBar.variant` | Proposed; no evidence on `main`           |
| FR2 | `Item` MUST render each side's panel from its entries into an out-of-flow position on its existing root and MUST add no element to the row for it. The gesture MUST drive the row's travel by writing a custom property on the root; the root's transform MUST read it and each panel's transform its negation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | DEC-5; `useToastGesture`                                                        | Proposed; real-Chromium evidence required |
| FR3 | `swipeBehavior` MUST be one enum with the closed values `reveal` and `commit`, default `reveal`. `commit` with more than one entry on a side MUST warn in development, because the other entries have no touch path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | DEC-2; `spec:AST-002` FR15                                                      | Proposed                                  |
| FR4 | A sideways drag on a coarse pointer MUST move the row and uncover the side's panel, showing each entry's `label` and `icon` as a filled surface in its `variant`'s colour; the panel MUST NOT be visible at rest, by any pixel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Real-browser finding: a zero-width panel still paints its padding               | Proposed; real-Chromium evidence required |
| FR5 | Under `reveal`, a release past the panel's width MUST leave the row resting open with every entry tappable, and a drag past the commit point or a fling MUST fire the **outermost** entry and no other. Under `commit`, a release past the commit point or a fling MUST slide the row out and fire the outermost entry; nothing MUST rest. After any entry fires, under either model, the row MUST spring back unless the entry has `hasRemoval`, in which case it MUST hold out at the edge it travelled toward. That bit is the only thing an entry declares about the row; the component MUST NOT wait on, observe, or act on what the caller does next, and MUST NOT warn if a held-out row is never removed. A release short of the threshold MUST spring back under both models. `onActivate` MUST fire at activation and may return a Promise. | DEC-1, DEC-2; UIKit `performsFirstActionWithFullSwipe`                          | Proposed; real-device evidence required   |
| FR6 | The drag MUST decide its axis once, early, and a mostly vertical drag MUST stay the scroller's. A mouse MUST NOT start the drag. The click the browser synthesizes after a drag MUST NOT fire the row's primary action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Press-model ORD1                                                                | Proposed; real-device evidence required   |
| FR7 | A resting row MUST close on a pointer landing anywhere outside it, on Escape with focus inside it, on firing an entry, and on unmount. Because a drag on a neighbour is a pointer outside it, at most one row rests open at a time without any shared state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | DEC-3; SwiftUI `swipeActionsContainer()` for the outcome                        | Proposed                                  |
| FR8 | Directions MUST be logical: `trailing` is uncovered by a drag toward the inline start and sits at the inline end; `leading` the reverse; so the finger, the uncovered edge, and the panel agree under RTL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `architecture:public-component-api` INV2 (logical direction)                    | Proposed                                  |
| FR9 | The element containing swipe-capable rows MUST clip in the inline axis with `overflow-inline: clip`, never `hidden`. `List` MUST set it; `Item`'s consumer documentation MUST state the obligation for any other host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | DEC-5; `List` root styles                                                       | Proposed                                  |

### Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — The panel is real while resting and absent while closed.** Under
  `reveal`, while the row rests open each entry MUST be a real, focusable
  `<button>` named by `label`, so a touch screen reader that lands on it can
  activate it; while closed the panel MUST be out of the accessibility tree
  and the tab order. Under `commit` the panel MUST be presentational
  (`aria-hidden`) at all times, because nothing in it is ever tappable.
- **AR2 — The gesture touches nothing on a pointer that can hover.**
  `swipeActions` MUST have no effect on the tab order, the accessible tree,
  or the row's paint on such a pointer. Hover MUST NOT uncover the panel.
- **AR3 — The row's primary stays one tab stop.** `swipeActions` MUST NOT
  change the primary element's role, name, or activation, and MUST add no
  stop while closed.
- **Stated in documentation, not enforced:** a swipe is a touch accelerator,
  so a verb reachable only by swipe is unreachable by keyboard and by mouse.
  The consumer documentation of `swipeActions` MUST say so and MUST show the
  verb also reachable through the row's own content. The component does not
  inspect what else the row offers.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: every supported renderer and browser.
  Pointer type is read from the pointer event.
- Unsupported behavior: a device that never produces a coarse pointer gets
  no swipe and nothing else changes.
- Browser evidence: FR2 and FR4–FR9 are paint and gesture claims. jsdom has
  neither; real-Chromium evidence with dispatched touch is required, and
  FR5/FR6 additionally need a physical touch device, because Chromium evidence
  for this gesture has not predicted device behavior.

## Current-state impact

- `Item` gains `swipeActions`, `swipeBehavior`, the exported types
  `ItemSwipeAction` and `ItemSwipeActionVariant`, two out-of-flow panel
  positions on its root with a theme target, and the root and panel
  transforms. No new element, no gesture on any row that does not ask for
  it. `component:Item`, when written, inherits these claims.
- `ListItem` inherits both props through its existing `Item` passthrough.
- `component:List` gains the inline clip on `List`'s root, citing this
  record.
- `architecture:interaction-modality` gains `spec:AST-057` in its deciding
  specs; no invariant changes.
- `contributing:api-conventions` gains the rule this record relies on: a
  gesture is an accelerator and never a component's only path to its own
  behavior.
- `spec:AST-058` takes nodes where this record takes objects, on the shared principle in
  DEC-1: the picker places its actions; `Item` renders its panel.
- No shipped public API changes on this record's own merge.
- While this record is `draft` its `review-applicability:v1` block routes
  nothing: global routing loads `current` claims only
  (`architecture:knowledge-contracts` INV20).

Known verification gap: none of the suites above exist on `main`, and no

review, and names no implementation.

## Decision log

Every decision below records the owner's direction; the record is `draft`
until `approved_by` is set.

### DEC-1 — Swipe actions are declared as data

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

`swipeActions.leading` and `.trailing` are `ItemSwipeAction[]`: `{id?, label,
icon?, onActivate, isDisabled?, variant?, hasRemoval?}`. `Item` renders each entry —
under `reveal` as a real button, under `commit` as a presentational block —
and paints the panel during the drag from the data.

An object is needed where the component renders the thing; a node works where it only places it (`spec:AST-058` DEC-1 draws the same line from the other side, and its picker-row actions are nodes because the picker only places them in a cell). `Item` paints and animates the panel, so every field is known before the gesture begins; a caller's own node could do neither without registering through a context, which splits the API into nodes that get the behavior and nodes that silently do not. Core already declares a verb as data
in `DropdownMenu.items` and `MoreMenu.items`, and two independent vibe-test recall probes — one for this record, one for
`spec:AST-058` — found every builder reaching for exactly this array with no
prop names given, and none reaching for child components or a render prop.

The vocabulary: `onActivate` is core's word for a row's verb firing by a
path that is not a click (`useMenuPress`, `useTreeFocus`, `Selector`,
`TreeList`), and a commit fires on release with no click at all. `variant` is
`'neutral' | 'accent' | 'destructive'`, with `accent` the default (DEC-6). `label` names the state the verb reaches ("Unread"), because the panel
shares one row width with the title it uncovers and the gesture already
supplies the verb. `hasRemoval` is one bit the component cannot infer: after
the action fires, does the row spring back or hold out? It is independent of
`swipeBehavior` — a commit is not a removal, and a tap on a resting "Archive"
is — and of `variant`, since Archive leaves without being destructive and a
soft Delete with Undo is destructive while the row stays. It takes `has*`
because it declares a property of the action, not a state the row is in. It
is nothing more than the resting position: not a promise the caller removes
the row, so no obligation and no warning; not an animation, so nothing
collapses or fades; not a timing rule, so `onActivate` still fires at
activation.

Composition is deferred, not lost: a `render*`-shaped addition for a panel
the vocabulary cannot draw can land when a caller needs it. How a held-out
row leaves, and how a kept row returns, is not this record's (Non-goals).

Rejected: nodes per side with a shipped `ItemSwipeAction` component — it
needed context registration for `commit`, and left any caller-supplied node
silently without it. Rejected: one action per side with `onAction` and a four-tone `tone` — a
second verb vocabulary. Rejected: a wider `hasRemoval` that promised the caller would remove the row, owned the exit animation, and fired `onActivate` after it — it made a confirm-first delete an exception and tied the resting bit to
the unsettled exit animation. Rejected: `isCommitExit` — the bit applies under `reveal` too, so naming it after commit is wrong.

### DEC-2 — Rest is the default; commit is a caller choice for one verb

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

`swipeBehavior: 'reveal' | 'commit'`, default `reveal`. Under `reveal` the
row rests open and a long drag fires the outermost entry; under `commit` the row slides out and the outermost entry fires. The slide-out is the gesture's own confirmation; where the row rests afterwards is the entry's `hasRemoval`, not the model's — a commit is not a removal — and the component waits for nothing after firing. `commit` means the same on every row that has swipe actions; no host narrows it.

Where a platform offers both, the full swipe is defined over the resting
list — UIKit's flag is
[`performsFirstActionWithFullSwipe`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiswipeactionsconfiguration),
indexing the resting actions — so resting is the model that holds several
verbs and commit is the one that holds exactly one; the count and the rest
state are one question, which is why `commit` with several entries on a side
warns. A resting panel also gives a touch user something to see before a
destructive verb fires, which is why it is the default. Commit is kept because both models are wanted, and it is what the row this
gesture was modelled on uses for its one-verb rows.

Rejected: commit-only as the sole model — it cannot grow into resting
without a default change. Rejected: a boolean `hasFullSwipe` — under `reveal` the full swipe is already on and under `commit` it is the whole behavior, so a boolean gates the wrong axis. Rejected: a `hasCommitAnimation` flag — the slide-out is how a commit confirms and `commit` already decides it; a second switch for one thing is the boolean-plus-handler duplication rejected on `hasCreate`. Rejected: requiring the row to stay out after every commit (#6821) — a committed "Mark read" row is still there.

### DEC-3 — The capability is `Item`'s; where it is available follows the row's role

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-03`

`Item` owns `swipeActions` and `swipeBehavior`. `ListItem` inherits them
through its existing passthrough and declares nothing of its own; a bare
`Item` in a product's own markup gets them the same way. Where swipe actions are available follows one rule: the row's role must
permit interactive descendants, because a swipe panel's controls are
interactive descendants of the row. A `listitem` and a role-less `Item`
qualify; `option`, the `menuitem*` roles, and a row that is the enlarged
target of a native radio do not, and are out of scope — not narrowed to one
model, not warned about per call, simply not served. A rule about the role
rather than a list of components means a row type nobody has written yet
sorts itself, and a scope boundary keeps `swipeBehavior` meaning one thing
everywhere it exists. Open state is the row's own: a pointer landing anywhere outside a
resting row closes it, and a drag on a neighbour is such a pointer, so one
row rests open at a time with no group state and no coordinating hook.

Only the component that owns the root can translate it, and a wrapper around
the row is ruled out by the HTML list content model — it would sit between
`<ul>` and `<li>` — so the gesture has to live where the root lives. Of `Item`'s seven in-core renderers, six give the row a role that forbids
interactive descendants; the seventh is `ListItem`, and the system's own templates render a bare `Item`
outside any list, so the capability has two consumers rather than one, which is why it stays
on the primitive: list rows and standalone rows share one home, and the
excluded rows are excluded by their role, not by where the prop lives.

Rejected: moving the prop to `ListItem` now that six of `Item`'s seven
in-core renderers are out of scope — it would put the prop only where it is
most used and take it from the standalone row, a real consumer the system's
own templates render. Rejected: deciding scope per model — permitting `commit` where `reveal` is
forbidden — because it couples a design choice (what the row does when
swiped) to a structural constraint (what the host may contain), so the same
prop value behaves differently by host. Rejected: a behavior hook that hosts
compose — one-open-at-a-time was its reason to exist as group state, and
outside-close gives the same outcome with nothing shared. Rejected: an
imperative or controlled open — nothing has asked, and the gesture already
owns the one coordination case.

### DEC-4 — No hover reveal

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-4`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

On a pointer that can hover, `swipeActions` does nothing. The gesture is a
touch accelerator and changes nothing on any other input; what a row offers
a mouse or a keyboard is the row's own content, which this record does not
govern.

Rejected: a reveal axis that rendered the same actions as hover-revealed
buttons on a fine pointer — a second surface for verbs the row's content can
already carry. [React Aria's iOS List example](https://react-aria.adobe.com/examples/ios-list)
takes that route (a panel button in the tree, revealed on focus) and is the
alternative this decision sets aside.

### DEC-5 — The root translates and the panels counter-translate; no element is added

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-5`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

`Item` renders each side's panel as an absolutely positioned child of its
existing root, at the inline start or end, above the root's background and
below the content. The drag writes its travel as a custom property on the
root — the way `useToastGesture` writes `--_toast-swipe-y` — the root's
transform reads it, and each panel's transform reads its negation, so the
row moves and the panel appears fixed in the space the row vacates. Both are
compositor transforms and the cancellation is exact. No element is added to
any row. The group clips with `overflow-inline: clip`. The positions are
internal: no public slot is admitted for them.

Layering and translation are different problems and neither needs a new
element. Layering is absolute positioning inside a containing block the root
already provides, with `isolation: isolate` on the root so a negative
`z-index` on the panel stays local (the 2026-09-04 isolation ruling).
Translation is the root's own transform: the content is four siblings in
every render mode, and the root is already their common parent. The root's
own styles survive the transform — no `overflow` or `contain` on it, the
focus-within outline and the theme target ride it. The clip cannot be the
row's, because the row is the thing moving, so it is the group's; `hidden`
would create a scroll container and fight the list's vertical scroller.

Rejected: a wrapper element inside `Item`, conditional or not — a second
row shape for CSS and tests to straddle, for a problem the root's transform
already solves. Rejected: a clipping container around a new inner row — an element on
every swiping row. Rejected: panels as siblings at
the list level, positioned at each row's offset — a position-sync loop
against resize, reflow and virtualized mounts. Rejected: animating
`padding-inline-start` on the root — layout on every frame under a finger
instead of a compositor transform. Rejected: public `beforeContent` /
`afterContent` slots — nothing in this record needs them, and general
anatomy takes its own admission.

### DEC-6 — The verb variant set is `neutral | accent | destructive`, minted knowingly

**Reference:** `spec:AST-057/DEC-6`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

`ItemSwipeActionVariant` is `'neutral' | 'accent' | 'destructive'`: three
flavours of verb — ordinary, the one you mean, the dangerous one — and
`accent` is the default on a swipe panel, because the panel is a filled
surface that has to be some colour and `ProgressBar` already defaults a
filled surface to `accent`.

This is minted vocabulary, not reuse, and it was taken knowing that:
`accent` appears on no other variant enum in core except `ProgressBar`'s
default, and `Step.status` carries it as a status. The shared status set —
`success | warning | error` across seven components — names states, and a
verb is not a state: "Archive" is not a success and "Delete" is not an
error. `spec:AST-058` takes the same set for picker-row actions with
`neutral` as its default, so the vocabulary is one across the two surfaces
where a verb gets a colour.

Rejected: the status set — it would make a verb claim a state. Rejected: a `tone: 'accent' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'error'` — a status
set with one decorative member. Rejected: `Badge`'s variant map — it carries
decorative colours (`blue`, `cyan`, …) that a verb slot must not admit.
Rejected: the menu row's two-value `'default' | 'destructive'` — it has no
word for the one action a panel exists to offer.

## Open questions

None.

## Content boundary

The research that produced this record — the cross-library survey, the
shapes weighed, and the vibe test's design and scores — is a report, not a contract, and lives outside it.

This record does not duplicate `Item`'s or `List`'s anatomy, prop tables,
theming targets, or geometry contracts; the modality invariants in
`architecture:interaction-modality`; the admission argument in
`spec:AST-002`; the press model in `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress`; or the
gesture constants an implementation will hold in source. It links their
canonical owners.
