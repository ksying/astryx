# Local stacking and browser top-layer routing system spec

<!-- review-applicability:v1 -->

```json
{
  "scope": "global",
  "triggers": {
    "layering": ["DEC-1", "DEC-2", "DEC-3", "DEC-4", "FR11"]
  }
}
```

## Intent

An Astryx component should be able to order its own painted parts without
changing how unrelated components, page content, or application chrome stack.
Menus, dialogs, and other floating interaction surfaces should escape ordinary
document stacking through Astryx's Layer system and the browser top layer, not
through larger `z-index` values.

This spec separates two mechanisms:

- **local stacking** orders parts inside one component-owned surface; and
- **top-layer routing** hosts floating interaction surfaces through
  [`architecture:layer-runtime`](../../architecture/layer-runtime.md).

A local number never becomes a claim on the whole page.

## Non-goals

- Define shadows, borders, or perceived elevation. Those remain visual-design
  concerns.
- Create a global numeric z-index scale or semantic page-wide z-index tokens.
- Change which interaction dismisses a menu, dialog, popover, or other overlay.
- Require `isolation: isolate` on components that have no local paint-order
  relationship.
- Treat a React portal as equivalent to browser top-layer promotion.

## Terms

- **Local layer:** a positioned or stacking-context descendant whose paint order
  is meaningful only inside one component-owned surface.
- **Isolation owner:** the component-owned element that establishes
  `isolation: isolate` for one local stacking relationship.
- **Surface owner:** the element that paints or directly owns the component
  surface whose parts are being ordered, including its background, border,
  clipping, or elevation boundary.
- **Floating interaction surface:** a menu, dialog, popover, tooltip, hover card,
  sheet, command surface, or similar UI that must escape ordinary content or
  clipping to perform its interaction role.
- **Browser top layer:** the platform stacking plane entered through native
  mechanisms such as the Popover API or modal `<dialog>`.

## Requirements

### Local stacking

- **FR1 — z-index is local only.** A `z-index` value in Astryx MUST order parts
  within one component-owned stacking relationship. It MUST NOT establish an
  ordering contract against unrelated components, application content,
  AppShell chrome, or another page region.
- **FR2 — The surface owns the isolation boundary.** Every local stacking
  relationship MUST have an `isolation: isolate` owner on the component surface
  that contains the relationship. The isolation boundary MUST live on the
  surface owner rather than an arbitrary page wrapper or distant ancestor.
- **FR3 — The isolation owner does not escalate itself.** The outer isolation
  owner MUST remain at its normal parent paint level. Local `z-index` values
  belong to descendants inside that owner. If a nested surface must be ordered
  inside a larger component, that larger component supplies another local
  isolation owner.
- **FR4 — Local values have no system-wide rank.** Values such as `-1`, `0`, `1`,
  `2`, or a dynamic local depth MAY express a relationship inside an isolation
  owner. The same value MAY mean something different in another component.
  Astryx MUST NOT document or depend on page-wide bands such as “inputs at 1,”
  “sticky content at 10,” or “overlays at 1000.”
- **FR5 — Fix the leaking owner, not the unrelated neighbor.** When a component
  part paints above unrelated UI, the fix MUST contain that part at its
  component-owned surface. Raising the unrelated header, shell, or neighbor to a
  larger value is not a conforming fix.
- **FR6 — Every local state stays contained.** Hover, focus, validation, drag,
  sticky, selected, resized, animated, and negative-layer states MUST remain
  inside the same isolation boundary. A state change MUST NOT promote the
  component surface into a page-level stacking competitor.

### Floating interaction surfaces

- **FR7 — Floating interactions use the Layer system.** Menus, dialogs,
  popovers, tooltips, hover cards, sheets, command surfaces, and equivalent
  floating interactions MUST use the hosting and promotion mechanisms owned by
  [`architecture:layer-runtime`](../../architecture/layer-runtime.md). A local
  component MUST NOT recreate that system with positioned DOM and page-level
  `z-index`.
- **FR8 — Browser promotion owns cross-surface order.** A floating interaction
  that must escape ordinary content or clipping MUST enter the browser top layer
  through the applicable Layer/native host. A body portal, a fixed position, or
  a larger number is not a substitute.
- **FR9 — Numeric values inside a top-layer host remain local.** A promoted
  surface MAY use locally isolated z-index values to order its own backdrop,
  panel, arrow, controls, or animation plates. Those values MUST NOT be treated
  as the reason the surface appears above page content or another native host.
- **FR10 — Existing Layer support boundaries remain authoritative.** Native
  Popover and modal-dialog behavior, corrective portals, anchored positioning,
  reduced browser fallback, and global-host admission continue to follow
  `architecture:layer-runtime` and
  [AST-003](../AST-003/spec.md). This spec does not authorize a component to
  bypass those contracts when native support is unavailable.
- **FR11 — In-flow UI remains in flow.** A label, status message, banner, sticky
  page region, focus ring, or other in-flow presentation does not become a
  floating interaction merely because it needs local paint ordering. It follows
  FR1–FR6 unless its owning contract explicitly assigns it to Layer.

### Implementation requirements

- **IR1 — Every shipped z-index is classified.** Before this spec ships,
  every production `z-index` in published package source and CLI-emitted template
  source MUST be classified as a contained local relationship, a local
  relationship inside a Layer/native top-layer host, or a migration gap.
  Unclassified values fail the migration.
- **IR2 — New leaks fail mechanically.** Repository checks MUST reject a new
  local z-index relationship that has no component-owned isolation surface.
  The check MAY use source metadata or a narrow allowlist for relationships
  whose owner cannot be derived statically, but an allowlist entry MUST name
  its owner and verification.
- **IR3 — Layer bypasses fail mechanically.** Repository checks MUST reject a
  new menu, dialog, popover, tooltip, hover card, sheet, command surface, or
  equivalent overlay that uses page-level z-index instead of the shared Layer
  or native top-layer path.
- **IR4 — Migrations remove obsolete bands.** When a surface is contained or
  moved into the top layer, obsolete page-wide z-index comments, constants,
  tokens, tests, and compensating neighbor values MUST be removed in the same
  change.

### Platform support

- Supported feature/engine floor: `isolation: isolate` defines local stacking in
  every browser supported by Astryx. Floating-surface support follows the matrix
  and reduced fallback in `architecture:layer-runtime`.
- Unsupported behavior: a browser below the native Layer feature floor receives
  the documented reduced fallback. It MUST NOT receive an undocumented global
  z-index ladder as an attempted top-layer polyfill.
- Browser evidence: local containment requires real-browser paint and hit-test
  evidence. Popover, modal-dialog, focus/inertness, and top-layer ordering require
  the real-browser matrix named by `architecture:layer-runtime`; Playwright WebKit
  does not substitute for Safari-specific evidence.

## Current-state impact

The repository already contains good examples of the intended local pattern:
Thumbnail, Calendar, ChatComposer, ChatLayout, CodeBlock, CheckboxInput,
RadioList, Switch, Slider, Field's attached-status wrapper, and the touch
DateInput panel place internal z-index relationships beneath a local
`isolation: isolate` owner. They are migration references, not blanket proof
that every descendant is correct.

The source audit covered published package source and CLI-emitted template source:
`packages/{core,lab,charts,richtext}/src` and
`packages/cli/assets/templates`, excluding tests and stories. It found 56
production declarations across 40 files and these current gaps:

Current source already routes Tooltip, HoverCard, Popover, DropdownMenu and its
submenus, ContextMenu, CommandPalette, modal Dialog, Lab Drawer, Lightbox,
MobileNav, Tour, Date-input layers, and RadialTooltip through Layer, native
Popover, or `showModal()`. Their cross-page mechanism is directionally
conforming. The confirmed exceptions are ChartTooltip and the non-modal
BottomSheet and BottomSheetSwitcher paths. Toast is promoted but still has the
global-host limitation already owned by AST-003.

This table is an impact inventory, not an implementation approval. Each row still
requires its named browser evidence before migration lands. The exhaustive IR1
audit may add rows; a row may be cleared only with named ownership and evidence.

### Completion criteria

This spec moves to `shipped` only when:

- every z-index in published package source and CLI-emitted template source has
  an owner and classification;
- every ordinary local relationship is contained by its component-owned painted
  surface;
- the real docsite Field/AppShell failure is reproduced before the fix and passes
  through local containment afterward;
- menus, dialogs, popovers, tooltips, hover cards, sheets, command surfaces, and
  equivalent overlays use the Layer/native top-layer path;
- numeric bands no longer determine cross-component, page-shell, or overlay
  order;
- mechanical checks reject a representative local leak and Layer bypass;
- the browser matrices for local containment and Layer hosting pass; and
- `architecture:layer-runtime` plus affected family/component records describe
  the shipped ownership without relying on this impact inventory.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — z-index expresses local relationships only

**Reference:** `spec:AST-027/DEC-1`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-04`

A z-index value belongs to one component-owned stacking relationship. Reusing a
number elsewhere creates no relationship between the components.

Rejected: a global scale that ranks inputs, sticky navigation, page chrome, and
overlays against one another. That scale turns every local change into a page-wide
compatibility problem.

### DEC-2 — Isolation lives on the component surface

**Reference:** `spec:AST-027/DEC-2`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-04`

The element that owns the painted surface also establishes `isolation: isolate`.
Descendant z-index values can then order that surface's parts without escaping to
unrelated content.

Rejected: placing isolation on an arbitrary page wrapper or raising the surface
root itself. Both preserve hidden coupling between the component and its caller.

### DEC-3 — Floating interactions use the browser top layer through Layer

**Reference:** `spec:AST-027/DEC-3`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-04`

Menus, dialogs, and equivalent floating interactions route through Astryx's Layer
system and applicable native top-layer host. Their cross-surface order comes from
the browser host and Layer contract, not a number.

Rejected: fixed positioning, a body portal, or a large z-index as a substitute for
Layer. These mechanisms do not provide native top-layer, modal, association,
positioning, or dismissal behavior.

### DEC-4 — Leaks are repaired at their owner

**Reference:** `spec:AST-027/DEC-4`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-09-04`

When a Field or another component covers unrelated shell chrome, contain the
component at its own surface. Do not raise AppShell or add another global band.

Rejected: escalating the AppShell header to a larger page-level value. It can
pass a known comparison only by outranking today's values and leaves the next
larger value to recreate the same defect.
